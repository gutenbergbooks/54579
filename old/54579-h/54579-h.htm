<small>AN IDLE BOY GETS A JOB.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Here she comes.”</p>

<p>Doug’ Jackson, the driver of the Scottsville
House ’bus, rose from the edge of the depot platform,
hitched up his trousers, and motioned the
usual depot loungers back to safety. All were
waiting for passenger train No. 22, west bound,
due at 11:15 A. M., and late, as usual.</p>

<p>“She’s made up seven minutes,” Doug’ announced
authoritatively after consulting a large
silver watch. “She’s fannin’—git back there,
you kids.”</p>

<p>No one else yet saw or heard the approaching
train, whose proximity was only detected by
Doug’s long experience in such matters; but all
necks were craned toward the grade east of town
and the curve at its far end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>One of these anxious watchers was Mr. Josiah
Elder, a man just beyond middle age, who
shaved every morning down to a round patch of
whiskers on a prolonged chin, and whose white
starched shirt and heavy gold watch chain proclaimed
him a person of affairs. Just at present,
a heavy coat of dust on a new, black, soft hat
and on his dark trousers suggested that the
morning had been spent out of doors, where the
September drought had coated the town and
country with suffocating dust.</p>

<p>Mr. Elder was president of the Scottsville
First National Bank. He was also president of
the Scott County Joint Stock Agricultural and
Trotting Association. And this was Wednesday
morning of fair week. The president was hot,
dusty, and had an anxious look.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Elder,” exclaimed Doug’ hastily,
lifting his cap with his badge as “runner” on it,
and glancing hastily along the track to be sure
that his announcement had not been premature.
“Train’ll be here right away.”</p>

<p>“Morning,” replied the anxious fair official,
looking toward a dusty, side-bar buggy and a
lively looking horse hitched just beyond the ’bus.
“Keep your eye on my rig, Doug’.”</p>

<p>Just then a hollow whistle sounded far up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
track, and a moment later, beneath a puff of
white steam that drifted around the curve, a billow
of black smoke told that No. 22 was “fanning”
down grade toward the town.</p>

<p>“I’m lookin’ for a man named Dare—T. Glenn
Dare. If you see him, he ain’t goin’ to the hotel.
He’s goin’ with me.”</p>

<p>“What’s the prospec’s fur fair week?” asked
Doug’, indicating that he understood. “I reckon
that airship’ll bring out a fine attendance ’bout
Thursday.”</p>

<p>“We hope so,” replied Mr. Elder impressively.
“It is a novel attraction of great educational
value. And it is an expensive feature.
The people o’ Scott County should recognize our
enterprise and turn out liberally.”</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s goin’ to kind o’ crowd you to git
everything in shape on time, ain’t it? All the
boxes and the injine is over there in the freight
house yit.”</p>

<p>“We are waiting for Mr. Dare. He’s the manufacturer’s
agent and operator.”</p>

<p>The oncoming train was already pounding
over the switch track frogs at the town limits.
Doug’ mustered up his courage, crowded a little
closer to the disturbed fair official and exclaimed,
nervously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Elder, I’ll keep my eye out fur
him. And your rig’ll be all safe. Say, Mr.
Elder, you couldn’t spare me a ticket fur the
fair, could ye?”</p>

<p>But this appeal was lost. The mogul engine,
hissing as if annoyed at its enforced stop in
Scottsville, slid to a grinding stop, panted a few
times, and then with a sharp clang of its bell and
a deep snort, was off again. The crowd, always
anxious to see the train come in, edged forward,
fell back and grouped itself about a dozen arrivals.
Two traveling men, or “drummers,”
Doug’ captured. The others were either not
strangers to the depot crowd or easily identified
by their luggage and costume as visitors from
near by towns. Mr. T. Glenn Dare was not
among those who alighted.</p>

<p>Having made sure of this fact, President
Elder’s strained look at once turned into one of
complete annoyance.</p>

<p>“I reckon yer man didn’t git here,” remarked
the talkative ’bus driver. “Maybe he’ll
be on seventeen.”</p>

<p>One look at the official’s face convinced Doug’
that it was not the time to renew his request for
a free ticket. Mr. Elder hurried into the depot,
and with no attempt to restrain his anger, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
up the ticket office of the fair association on the
telephone.</p>

<p>To some one, he rapidly explained that Mr. T.
Glenn Dare, the expert who was to set up and
operate the aeroplane for the fair directors had
not arrived. The boxed and crated airship had
been in the depot freight house for a week. It
was now Tuesday of the week of the fair, and a
flight had been advertised for Wednesday afternoon
at three o’clock. Operator Dare, who was
to make this at the rate of fifty dollars a day,
had been expected Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” answered the president to the
person with whom he had been talking, “we’ve
saved one hundred dollars, but that ain’t it.
We’ve got to exhibit our aeroplane to-morrow,
or let the people know we can’t. We’ve paid
one thousand eight hundred dollars in good
money for the thing, and it ain’t worth a nickel
to us over there in the freight depot.”</p>

<p>There was more talk, and then President Elder
ended the conversation by announcing:</p>

<p>“There isn’t any use to haul the boxes out to
the ground, if the man don’t come. We’ll wait
until the night train. If he ain’t on that, we’ll
send out bills callin’ the show off. Then we’ll
ship the machine back East and sue the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for failure to keep its contract. They agreed to
have a competent man here, and they’ve thrown
us down.”</p>

<p>As the perspiring Mr. Elder came out of the
hot ticket-office of the musty-smelling station
and paused on the platform to wipe his red face,
his eye fell on the freight-house across the tracks
from the station. He glanced at his horse to see
that it was all right, and then sprang across to
the freight-depot. He had not yet seen the valuable
crates consigned to him. The freight-agent
had already gone to dinner. Entering the long
shed, he glanced inquiringly about. It was half
dark.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for your aeroplane, Mr. Elder?”
exclaimed a pleasant boyish voice from somewhere
in the gloom.</p>

<p>The banker and fair president traced the
sounds to their source. At the far end of the
room and opposite a rear door stood a mound of
carefully packed and braced skeleton-like
frames. On the edge of a heavy square box
bound with steel bands, sat a boy of perhaps
seventeen or eighteen. Although it was hot, the
lad was wearing a heavy blue flannel shirt, a red
neck tie, and a cheap, sailor hat. His low shoes
were worn and old, and his socks gave signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
needing a mother’s care. He was slowly fanning
himself with a big blue handkerchief.</p>

<p>“If you are,” added the boy, springing to his
feet, “here it is; and it looks like the real thing.”</p>

<p>Instead of examining the aeroplane crates,
Mr. Elder’s eye swept the boy from hat to shoes.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you Bud Wilson?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Attorney Cyrus Stockwell is my
foster father.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” rejoined the banker tartly.
“I’ve heard of you. Lafe Pennington, of our
bank, has told me about you.”</p>

<p>The boy laughed—he had already taken off
his discolored hat.</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t hear much good about me,
that’s certain.”</p>

<p>“No,” soberly answered the elder man, “to
tell you the truth, I’ve never heard much good
about you.”</p>

<p>The boy laughed again, but in an embarrassed
way, showed his confusion, and then said:</p>

<p>“Lafe and I never got along. But, he may be
right. I’ve got a bad name.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here? You are old
enough to be at work.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” went on Bud, “I ought to be. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
have a job promised me when I want it, out in
the country. But I’ve been waitin’ to see this.”</p>

<p>He pointed toward the dismantled airship.</p>

<p>“What do you want to see? You haven’t any
business loafing in here. Have you been monkeyin’
with the machinery?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know ’em around here. And I ain’t
hurt nothing. No fear o’ that.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your interest?”</p>

<p>“I want to see it. I’ve been waiting every
day since it came. I want to be here when you
move it. I want to help unpack it.”</p>

<p>“You? What do you know about aeroplanes?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—that is, almost nothing. But I
guess I know a little. You know I ran Mr. Greeley’s
automobile nearly all summer. I understand
motors. And—well, I do know something
about aeroplanes. I tried to make one this summer.”</p>

<p>A look of sudden interest showed in the banker’s
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember now, you are the youngster
that nearly broke his neck trying to fly.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Lafe Pennington told that,”
answered Bud, looking up. “Well, I didn’t. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
fell, but I lit on my feet, and I didn’t even harm
my aeroplane.”</p>

<p>President Elder was looking over the big
crates, and peering through the frames. Suddenly,
he turned to Bud again.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by <em>your</em> aeroplane?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t really an aeroplane. That is, I
didn’t have an engine; but I made the wings;
and I flew one hundred and fifty feet in them,
too, out at Greeley’s gravel pit.”</p>

<p>“Then you know how an aeroplane is made?”</p>

<p>“I think I do. They are all pretty much alike.
When I see this one, I’ll know a lot more.”</p>

<p>An idea was plainly working in President
Elder’s brain. He made a searching examination
of the lad before him. Then he asked:</p>

<p>“Didn’t you and Lafe Pennington work on
this airship idea together?”</p>

<p>Bud laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” he answered, “Lafe wouldn’t
work with any one. He knows too much. I
worked alone.”</p>

<p>President Elder looked at his watch. It was
just noon.</p>

<p>“Do you think you could put this airship together?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, I put my own together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bud, meet me here at one o’clock. I may
have a job for you.”</p>

<p>While the banker’s smart rig went clattering
up the brick street, Bud started for home on a
run.</p>

<p>Long before one o’clock, Bud was at the
freight-house again. In a short time, a dray and
an express wagon appeared. About the time
that a large farm wagon, drawn by two horses,
came in sight, Mr. Elder reappeared. In the
buggy with him was the young man referred to
several times by Mr. Elder and Bud an hour before—Lafe
Pennington. As they sprang from the
vehicle, Bud was on the freight-house platform.
Lafe passed the boy with a condescending smile;
but Mr. Elder stopped.</p>

<p>“Bud,” he began, “I had a kind of a notion
that I had a job for you, but I guess that’s all
off.”</p>

<p>“I hoped you had. I hurried back.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this way. I forgot that our clerk,
Mr. Pennington, had some knowledge of aeroplanes.
We are in a sort of a box, and after I
talked to you, I decided to try to get this machine
ready. The man who ought to do it isn’t here.
Even if he comes to-night, he won’t have time to
set it up. So, while I talked to you, I decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to try to put it together and have it ready when
he came. I was going to get you to help.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I?” asked the boy eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’ll need you now. I’ve got
Mr. Pennington. He says he can do it without
any trouble. And you know he’s in the bank,
and I know him. He’s one of our clerks.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he can do it, perhaps,” answered
Bud in a disappointed tone, “but I’d like to help
too. I’d work for nothing.”</p>

<p>“I suggested that, but Mr. Pennington says
he’d rather work alone.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder was about to pass on when Bud
touched his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Mr. Elder,” he said, “Lafe said that because
he knew I was the only person in Scottsville who
could help. I haven’t anything against Lafe,
but you ought to know the facts—I know more
about aeroplanes than he does. He may be able
to do what you want, and he may not. You may
think I’m knocking Lafe, but I’m not. I’m
just giving you the truth: he thinks he knows
more about airships than he really does.”</p>

<p>“You seem to feel sure you know it all,” almost
sneered the banker.</p>

<p>“I should say not,” answered the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
promptly. “I know hardly anything, and Lafe
knows less.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we get stuck, I suppose we can call
on you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be right there, waiting.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” exclaimed the banker laughing,
“we need plenty of help. Mr. Pennington may
not want you, but I do. Turn in and give us a
lift. Between us, we’ll see what we can do. We
are going to move these boxes out to the fair-ground,
and see if we can put our aeroplane together.
You’re hired to help.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE HERO OF THE GRAVEL PIT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Scott County Fair-grounds were a mile
and a half from Scottsville. A little after two
o’clock, the “aeroplane” cavalcade was on its
way there from the freight-house. In front, rode
President Elder of the fair association, with
Lafayette, or Lafe, Pennington, the bank clerk
and amateur dabbler in aeronautics, by his side.
Then came a dray with the four-cylinder,
25-horse power, 190 lb. Curtiss engine elaborately
crated. Next was an express wagon with
boxed engine accessories, such as gasoline tank,
water cooler, chain drives, and the dismounted
propeller blades. In the rear, in the big farm
wagon, rode proud Bud Wilson, busy preserving
the balance of the spruce sections of the aeroplane
surfaces.</p>

<p>In the excitement attendant upon the fair, the
procession attracted little attention. Buggies
and passenger hacks raised clouds of dust in
which wagons laden with belated exhibits made
their way toward the great enclosure within
whose high white fence Scott County’s agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
exhibit was fast getting into final order.
At the sight of President Elder, the gate attendants
threw the white portals wide open, and Bud
had a new joy—he was working for the fair, and
didn’t have to pay to get in.</p>

<p>“I never did pay,” laughed Bud, speaking to
the driver of the wagon, “but this is the first
time I ever went in at the main gate.”</p>

<p>Winding their way among the plows, self-binders
and threshing-machines already in
place, and then directly between the two lines of
peanut, pop, candy, cider and “nigger baby”
stands—already making a half-hearted attempt
to attract trade—the aeroplane wagons passed
through the heart of the grounds. Near the
“grand stand,” where for ten cents extra, one
might view the trotting and running races, President
Elder alighted and personally superintended
the unlocking of the gates leading onto
the race-track. Across this, the three vehicles
made their way.</p>

<p>At the far end of the space within the smooth
half-mile race-track was a newly built shed,
made according to directions forwarded from the
aeroplane factory in New Jersey. In front of
this, the wagons halted. There were not many
persons in attendance that day on the fair, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
there were enough to make an audience of several
hundred at once. The aeroplane shed was a
temporary structure—a shed with a board top
and canvas sides. Willing hands soon had the
different sections of the car either in the house
or near by in front.</p>

<p>Lafe Pennington’s coat was off, and he superintended
the unloading with a great show of
authority. By this time, a carpenter and a
machinist had arrived, and the officious bank
clerk announced that spectators had better be
dispersed in order that he might work undisturbed.</p>

<p>“What do you want Bud to do?” asked President
Elder.</p>

<p>Lafe smiled feebly.</p>

<p>“Nothing just now,” he answered. “He can
stay outside and see that we are not disturbed.
I don’t think it will take us very long.”</p>

<p>The confident clerk started to enter the shed.</p>

<p>“How about the starting track and the derrick
for the drop weight?” asked Bud innocently. “I
don’t see any material here for those.”</p>

<p>Lafe stopped suddenly, and looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” he faltered, “where are
they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said President
Elder. “I guess everything’s here.”</p>

<p>Pennington made a quick survey.</p>

<p>“Oh, they are not here,” explained Bud. “I
discovered that some days ago.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” conceded Lafe. “They must
have forgotten them. We’ll have to telegraph
for them.”</p>

<p>“Telegraph nothing,” blurted the president.
“We’ve no time for telegraphing. They can’t
get ’em here in time. If it’s something you have
to have, I guess we are stuck.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” suggested Bud, “the manufacturers
expected you to make this apparatus on the
ground. The ropes and automatic release block
are here.”</p>

<p>“How can we do that?” sneered Pennington,
already irritated at the turn affairs were taking.</p>

<p>“Very easily, I imagine,” replied Bud, “if
they sent specifications. The manufacturer sent
word how to build a shed and how big to make
it. Didn’t they send a letter?” he asked, turning
to President Elder.</p>

<p>“Letter? Why, yes—I forgot that—a big
letter,” exclaimed Mr. Elder, reaching into his
inside pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Pennington took it, glanced it over hurriedly,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Sure, here it is, sketch, measurement, and
all.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I look after that?” asked Bud turning
from the president to Lafe.</p>

<p>“That’s carpenters’ work,” answered Pennington
at once. “We’ll have the carpenters
see to that. They can order the stuff by ’phone
at once.”</p>

<p>He turned again to begin the work of uncrating
the aeroplane.</p>

<p>“How long do you figure it’s going to take to
put the car together, Lafe?” asked Bud.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” retorted Pennington sharply,
“but I’ll get along all the faster if I’m not
stopped to talk about it.”</p>

<p>“It ought to be done to-night, shouldn’t it?”
queried Bud, turning to the president and showing
no irritation.</p>

<p>“Certainly, if possible.”</p>

<p>“Then we ought to get some lights—three or
four gasoline flares. That work can’t be done
before dark. It’s going to take all night. It’s
a tejous job. And after the frame is set up and
made fast, the engine must be tested and anchored
and the shafts set.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better get the lights ready?”
asked Mr. Elder of Pennington.</p>

<p>“Of course, we’ll need them,” answered Pennington,
who had in reality not thought of them.
“Better let Bud go to town for them.”</p>

<p>“All right. Here Bud, take my horse and
buggy and go to town, and get what’s needed at
Appleton’s hardware store. I’ll be at the ticket
office when you get back.”</p>

<p>Pennington had disposed of his rival temporarily,
but Bud took his defeat cheerfully. However,
he could not resist the temptation to turn
the tables once more.</p>

<p>“Want anything else?” he asked casually as
he climbed into the rig.</p>

<p>“Nothing more now,” answered Pennington,
turning away for the third time.</p>

<p>“You want gasoline for the lamps, don’t you?”
suggested Bud.</p>

<p>“Certainly—and matches, too,” said Lafe
with another sneer.</p>

<p>“Well, how about some gasoline for the engine?”</p>

<p>Lafe grew red in the face, and turned away
impatiently.</p>

<p>“And some oil for the engine?”</p>

<p>“You don’t expect a fellow to think of everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
at once, do you?” snorted Lafe. “I haven’t
been hanging over this thing for a week.
I’ve had something else to think about.”</p>

<p>“Seems as if Bud had done a good deal of
thinking,” suggested President Elder. “Hurry
back, Bud, we may need you again.”</p>

<p>Bud Wilson had long been pointed out as the
prize example of juvenile perverseness. Many
persons, including Lafe Pennington, were in the
habit of referring to him as a “bad” boy. But
in this, they were wrong. Bud’s differences from
other boys of better reputation meant no more
than that he was headstrong and so full of ideas
that the routine of school went hard with him.
The boy often shocked his teacher. Instead of
the old-fashioned speaking pieces, Bud was apt
to select some up-to-date newspaper story or
verse. Once he even ventured to recite some
poetry of his own, in which Miss Abbott, the
teacher, did not particularly shine.</p>

<p>When he was left an orphan and went to live
with Attorney Cyrus Stockwell, the lively
youngster gave up most of his school hours to
drawing engines. At that time, he planned to be
an engineer. Succeeding that, he aspired to be
a detective. In this new ambition, he read a
great deal of literature concerning crime. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
this new profession was soon forgotten with the
advent of aeroplanes. From the moment Bud
realized what a heavier-than-air flying-machine
meant, he was a rapt disciple of the world’s new
aviators.</p>

<p>Verses of his own and detective stories were
now forgotten. Given the task of writing an
essay, by Miss Abbott, for some lapse of discipline,
he produced a wonderful composition on
“The Airship.” It was so full of Jules Verne
ideas that Miss Abbott visited Bud’s foster
father, and suggested that something be done
with the boy.</p>

<p>The something that Attorney Stockwell did
was to take Bud out of school and put him at
work on rich Mr. Greeley’s farm, where, for a
time, he labored in a gravel pit shovelling.
Learning to operate the steam shovel, he became
the engineer, and after that, for some months in
the summer, he had been Mr. Greeley’s chauffeur.
Just now he was back home without a job, and a
half promise of another try at school when it
opened.</p>

<p>Lafe Pennington was everything Bud wasn’t.
He graduated from the high-school, and was a
clerk in the First National Bank. He was popular
with the young ladies, and already wore a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
moustache. Lafe’s interest in aeronautics was
older than Bud’s, but his knowledge was largely
superficial. Young Pennington’s information
did not extend much further than what he had
written in an essay he read before the Scottsville
Travel and Study Circle. This paper, entitled
“The Development of the Aeroplane,” had been
printed in the Globe-Register. Ever since its
publication, Lafe had been trying to live up to
the reputation it had brought him.</p>

<p>When Bud Wilson read the article, he at once
pronounced it a “chestnut,” and declared that
it was copied almost wholly from a magazine
and an old one at that. Bud repeated this statement
to Lafe himself on the memorable occasion
when the aeroplane or glider dumped Bud.</p>

<p>While running the steam shovel at Greeley’s
gravel pit, Bud had the long summer evenings
to himself. There was a tool house, plenty of
lumber, and, what prompted the manufacture of
the small aeroplane, several long, steep switch
tracks running down into the pit. After several
weeks of work, based on a mass of magazine
photographs, newspaper clippings, and scientific
paper detailed plans, Bud finally constructed a
pretty decent looking bi-plane airship, complete
in all respects except as to the engine. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
combination of the Curtiss planes and the
Wright rudders, with some ideas of Bud’s in the
wing warping apparatus.</p>

<p>This work was done in the abandoned engine
house on the slope of the gravel hill above the
pit. Lafe learned of the experiment through Mr.
Greeley, who was rather proud of his young engineer,
and who did not fail to talk about the
amateur airship to those in the bank.</p>

<p>As chief aviation authority in Scottsville,
Lafe felt it his duty to investigate. And, to
Bud’s annoyance, the bank clerk made his first
visit to the gravel pit on a Saturday afternoon
just as Bud was about to make a trial flight.</p>

<p>“What do you think of her?” asked Bud
proudly.</p>

<p>Lafe screwed up his mouth.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair, for a kid. But what’s the sense
of it? You haven’t an engine, and I reckon you
never will have one.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of it?” repeated Bud. “I
suppose you know the heavier-than-air car—the
aeroplane—was developed before the experimenters
had any power. If the Wright Brothers
had waited for an engine, they’d never had a machine.
The thing is to know how to fly. You can
only learn by flying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Lafe smiled in a superior way.</p>

<p>“All right,” he laughed. “Go ahead. I’ll
see that you have a decent funeral.”</p>

<p>Lafe even helped Bud carry the fragile frame
down to the head of the switch track grade where
Bud had a small tool car—no larger than a hand
car. On this the motorless planes were deposited,
and when Bud had taken his place on his
stomach on the lower frame, an idle workman
gave the car a shove.</p>

<p>To young Pennington’s gratification, the experiment
was a fiasco. Even after several trials,
it was found that the car would not get up sufficient
momentum. The model would not leave
the moving platform. Finally, Bud got grease
for the car wheels, and then stood up with his
arm pits resting on the light framework. As the
car reached the bottom of the incline, the boy
sprang forward. For one moment, the surfaces
caught and held the air and the planes seemed
about to rise. Then, with a sudden twist, the
frame sprang sideways and downward. Bud’s
feet struck the gravel and he stumbled. To keep
from mixing up with the car, he hurled it from
him. The aeroplane sank down with only a few
strains, but Bud landed on the side of his face.</p>

<p>The following Saturday, as a sort of a challenge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Bud invited Lafe and a reporter for the
Globe-Register to witness his second attempt.
This time he abandoned the car. The gravel pit
had been cut into the side of the hill. At the
edge of the pit, there was a sharp drop of nearly
fifty feet. When his guests were ready, Bud had
them raise the light car—only twenty feet long—on
his shoulders. Balancing the planes, he
gripped the lower struts, and before Lafe or the
reporter had time to protest, he ran a few feet
down the slope—the car had been removed to
the old engine house on the hill at the brink of
the pit—and stumbled over the precipice.</p>

<p>His guests caught their breaths. But Bud did
not fall. When he reached the gravel bed at the
bottom, he had flown one hundred and fifty feet,
and he came down easily and safely. It was the
account of this in the Globe-Register, under the
title of “First Aeroplane in Scott County” that
cemented Lafe’s jealousy of Bud’s nerve.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>SCOTTSVILLE’S FAIR SECURES AN AVIATOR.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When Bud returned from town, he had a buggy
full of material—three large cans of gasoline,
three gasoline flare torches, oil, waste, and—what
proved to be most essential—his scrap book
of airship pictures and plans. Everything was
confusion in the airship shed. The crowd had
pretty well cleaned out, but Lafe Pennington and
his two assistants did not seem to be working
with any more ease because of this.</p>

<p>On top of a box, the manufacturer’s drawings
and directions were spread out. One thing only
seemed to have been accomplished; everything
was uncrated.</p>

<p>“Put the stuff down, and don’t bother us,”
exclaimed Lafe at once. “There are too many
in here now. I won’t need you any more.”</p>

<p>Before he took his departure, Bud made a
hasty examination. Apparently everything was
being done backward. Pennington’s eagerness
to unpack and to knock boxes apart had made a
chaos out of the shed interior. There were no
signs of work on the ascending track and weight
derrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure you don’t want me to get that track
started?” Bud asked.</p>

<p>“See here, Bud, you seem to have that track
on the brain. I’ll set it up in a couple of hours
when I get around to it.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” answered Bud, with a smile, “I thought
it might take longer.” The dismissed boy re-entered
the buggy, and drove to the ticket office
at the gate. Mr. Elder appeared in a short time
with the Superintendent of the Grounds. The
possibility of keeping faith with the public by
flying the aeroplane the next afternoon was
under discussion.</p>

<p>“There’s a powerful lot to be done, even if
Mr. Dare gets here to-night,” commented Superintendent
Perry.</p>

<p>“How does it look to you, Bud?” asked
President Elder, turning to the boy—they were
all standing by the buggy. Bud said nothing.</p>

<p>“That’s what I think, too,” spoke up the
superintendent. “I’ve been over to the shed
twice this afternoon. Mr. Pennington may be a
fine bank clerk—and I guess he’s all right at
that—but he don’t strike me as no aeroplaner.
I’m afeared we’ve bit off more’n we can chew
in this deal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is he going to be able to finish the job?”
asked Mr. Elder, turning to Bud again.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. If he works all night.”</p>

<p>“All night?” exclaimed Superintendent Perry.
“Them mechanics’ll not stick all night. They’re
gettin’ ready to quit now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder sighed.</p>

<p>“Well, let him go ahead until the eight o’clock
train gets here. If the expert ain’t on it, I guess
we’ll call it off. We made a big mistake not
hirin’ that Roman Hippodrome and Wild West
Congress, but it’s too late now.”</p>

<p>Bud rode to town with Mr. Elder, after watching
his horse for an hour, and went sorrowfully
home. But he was by no means as despondent as
the Fair Association President. His brain had
been working all afternoon. When the eight
o’clock train came in without the eagerly longed
for Mr. Dare, Bud was at Mr. Elder’s elbow.
The president was boiling mad.</p>

<p>“I see he didn’t come yit,” ventured the all-observing
’bus driver, Doug’ Jackson. “Ef he
gits here on the one o’clock, I reckon I’d better
call you up and let ye know?”</p>

<p>This willingness to oblige was leading up to
another appeal for a pass, but Doug’ got a cold
reception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Needn’t bother,” responded Mr. Elder
curtly. “I’m done with these easterners and
Mr. Dare.”</p>

<p>He was hurrying to his buggy when Bud
touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>“Mr. Elder,” said the boy, in a businesslike
tone, “I’m pretty young to make any suggestions
to you, but I can help you out of your
trouble. I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>The angry fair official paused.</p>

<p>“Lafe Pennington is doing what he’s always
done—when it comes to this airship business—”</p>

<p>“Four flushin’,” interrupted Mr. Elder. “I
know that.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t put it that way,” added Bud,
“but he’s doin’ what Mr. Perry says—he’s bit
off more’n he can chew.”</p>

<p>“Well, what then? It don’t matter much.
Our flyin’ man ain’t here, and don’t look as if
he’d be here.”</p>

<p>“I can chew it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“From what I hear, you and Lafe are always
knockin’ each other,” he commented.</p>

<p>“That’s right. I’ve got a reason, and he
hasn’t. I can deliver the goods, and he can’t.
That’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you tryin’ to git at?”</p>

<p>“Put me in charge of that work out there, and
by noon to-morrow, I’ll have that aeroplane
ready to fly.”</p>

<p>“Alone?” said the man, after a moment’s
thought and turning on the boy suddenly.</p>

<p>“By noon, if I have carpenters to do what I
need, and earlier if Lafe will help.”</p>

<p>“Would you work with Mr. Pennington?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. He’s all right if he has some
one with him who knows. I know—I’ve figured
this all out.”</p>

<p>The puzzled official was plainly in a quandary.
Then he shook his head.</p>

<p>“What if you did? What’s the use of all this
fussin’ and rushin’ around? This feller to run
it ain’t here, and we can’t count on him now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder’s mouth opened.</p>

<p>“You mean go up in the machine?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And risk breakin’ your neck?”</p>

<p>“Hundreds are doing that every day. Hasn’t
been but two men broken their necks yet.”</p>

<p>“You’re foolish.”</p>

<p>“May be. But I’ll do it if you’ll give me the
chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The suggestion was too daring for President
Elder to pass on at once and alone. He lit a
cigar, looked at his watch, examined Bud in the
glare of the depot light, and then went into the
station and telephoned to some one. When he
came out, he motioned the boy to follow him, unhitched
his horse and told Bud to jump into the
buggy. Before he spoke they were on their way
to the fair-grounds once more.</p>

<p>“What makes you think you can do this? I
thought you had to be an expert?”</p>

<p>“Experts always have to have a first experience.
There isn’t any half bites. It’s whole
hog or none,” answered Bud.</p>

<p>“You had a half bite when you tumbled in the
gravel pit,” laughed his companion.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered the boy. “That was
riskier than this. I took more chances when I
jumped off the hill than I’ll be takin’ here.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to git your father’s consent,”
suggested the president as that thought struck
the cautious banker. “If we try it, we can’t
afford to be sued for damages.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any father.”</p>

<p>“Well, your guardian’s—I forgot. You’ll
have to sign an agreement waiving all claims.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, and I’ll do more. This expert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
was to get fifty dollars a day. I’ll work for
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Bud was silent a little spell. Then he answered.</p>

<p>“Because every one says I’m a tough kid just
because I ‘ditched’ school a few times. I’ve
never had a chance. I couldn’t even get work
except in a gravel pit. I’m anxious to ‘make
good’ in this town.”</p>

<p>The road to the fair-ground was now pretty
well deserted. Inside the exhibition enclosure,
the white tents and the little fires glowing here
and there under the trees gave the place the appearance
of a hunter’s camp in the woods. Hastening
forward in the dark, Mr. Elder drove at
once into the center of the race track. To his
and to Bud’s surprise, there was no glare of light
from the airship shed. They had expected to
find the place the center of activity.</p>

<p>“I reckon Mr. Pennington’s gone to supper,”
suggested Bud.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s given up,” said the president.</p>

<p>“You’re both wrong,” exclaimed a voice out
of the blackness. “I’ve just been over trying
to get you or Superintendent Perry on the
’phone,” went on the unseen speaker, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
easily recognized as Pennington. “I can finish
the job all right, but to be dead sure, I guess I
ought to have some help.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, they were at the shed, and
Lafe and the watchman lit the lanterns.</p>

<p>“That’s what we concluded,” said Mr. Elder
in a decisive tone. “And I’ve brought Bud
back. I guess you fellows had better work together.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Lafe. “I was going
to suggest Bud.”</p>

<p>The latter was already at work; his hat was
off, his shirt was off and his undershirt sleeves
were rolled up to the elbows. He was heating
and lighting the gasoline torches.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right now, Mr. Elder. We’ll get
along fine together, and you can go home and rest
in peace. We’ll deliver the machine on time,”
began Bud enthusiastically. “You won’t disappoint
the people.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Dare come?” asked Lafe, already
greatly relieved in getting out of his mess so
easily.</p>

<p>Mr. Elder shook his head.</p>

<p>“No. And I ain’t countin’ on him now. Looks
like we won’t need him.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Lafe, puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it comes to the worst, Bud says he can fly
the thing.”</p>

<p>“Bud?”</p>

<p>“Why not? I’m sort o’ persuaded he can.
I’m goin’ to see the directors about it to-night.
He’s willing to try.”</p>

<p>Lafe’s face turned red and white with anger
and surprise. He stammered and trembled.</p>

<p>“I think that’s a pretty raw deal, Mr. Elder,
after what I’ve done. If any one gets that
chance, I think I ought.”</p>

<p>“Did you want to go up in it?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I had no other idea, if the operator
didn’t come. I was going to ask as soon as
it was certain he couldn’t get here. I think I’ve
had a pretty hard turn down.”</p>

<p>He was lying, and his indignation was largely
assumed. But his jealousy of Bud made him
desperate.</p>

<p>Mr. Elder was puzzled. He looked from one
lad to the other.</p>

<p>“How about it, Bud?” he asked at last.
“Looks as if you were sort of second fiddle, don’t
it?”</p>

<p>Bud hesitated, wiped his hands on a bit of
waste and then smiled.</p>

<p>“You didn’t say I could do it,” he answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
at last, “though I’m ready to try. If you’d
rather have Lafe, all right. I’ll help get her
ready just the same. Don’t let me make any
trouble.”</p>

<p>The fair official looked relieved. From a
dearth of aviators, he now had an over supply of
them.</p>

<p>“Maybe Judge Pennington won’t consent to
your reskin’ your neck, Lafe,” he commented.</p>

<p>“I’m of age,” answered Lafe, “and can do
what I like.”</p>

<p>“And you think you can work it?”</p>

<p>There was a plain sneer on Lafe’s face.</p>

<p>“I guess I know as much about it as any one
around here, even if I haven’t fallen out of
one.”</p>

<p>“Maybe your fall’s comin’,” interrupted Bud,
with a broad grin.</p>

<p>“Well, settle it between you. We’ll count
on one of you. I’ll go to town and tell the other
directors.”</p>

<p>“Give it to him—give Lafe the chance if he
wants it,” volunteered Bud suddenly and significantly.</p>

<p>“You give up quick enough, I notice,” exclaimed
Lafe somewhat nervously. “I reckon
you ain’t afraid, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so you can notice it,” retorted Bud.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll count on you, Lafe,” concluded
President Elder.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” was Lafe’s answer, but it
lacked a good deal of being enthusiastic.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Elder’s buggy disappeared in
the darkness, Lafe wheeled toward Bud.</p>

<p>“You did that on purpose, Bud Wilson, just
to get me in a box.”</p>

<p>“You jump out, and let me in,” was Bud’s
sober rejoinder.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>A MIDNIGHT LUNCH.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“When you see me doing that, just tell me,”
retorted Lafe, with another sneer.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Bud, “I will.”</p>

<p>Surrounded by a wilderness of odds and ends,
the youthful rivals stood and faced each other.
Finally, Bud reached out his hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of scrappin’ Lafe? I guess
we don’t like each other any too well, but we
ought not let our grouch interfere with our
chance.”</p>

<p>“What chance have you?” asked the bank
clerk.</p>

<p>“Just a chance to get my hands on a real aeroplane.
And that’s all I want. But I won’t have
that if we don’t stop quarrelin’ and get to work.”</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if you thought I’d back out.”</p>

<p>“That’s up to you,” went on Bud. “I didn’t
say so.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to take orders and do as I
say?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Bud. “All I want is to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the thing fly. And, since you are the aviator, I
say ‘Good luck to you.’”</p>

<p>Lafe had ignored the proffered hand, but he
now relented a little.</p>

<p>“I want to be fair,” he said half-heartedly,
“and I’ll meet you half way. But I don’t intend
to work all night to give you a chance to show off
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Never fear,” answered Bud. “I had hopes
for a minute, but they were like all my other
chances.” And he whistled. “You’re it and
I’m nit. Come on, let’s forget our troubles.”</p>

<p>As he smiled and held out his hand again, Lafe
had not the heart to refuse it.</p>

<p>“Now,” went on Bud enthusiastically as the
two lads limply clasped hands, “we’re on the
job. What’s doin’?”</p>

<p>Within a few minutes, the rivalry was forgotten,
at least temporarily. The only headway
made so far was in the mounting or setting up of
a few sections of the frame. More than half of
the work was yet to be done; the front and rear
rudders were to be attached and levers adjusted;
the vulcanized silk covering of the two planes
had to be put in place and stretched; the landing
skids bolted on; the engine, gasoline tank, and
water cooler put in place and tested; the batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wired; the propellers and shafts located;
the chain gears and guards attached, and, possibly
most important, the starting rail and weight
derrick constructed. And it was then nine
o’clock.</p>

<p>“Let’s get started right,” suggested Bud,
“now that you have everything unpacked. Before
we go any further let’s see where we stand.”</p>

<p>As a result of a nearly thirty-minute conference,
these were the conclusions: A mechanic
must be found at once, if possible, to adjust the
engine, oil it and get it running; a carpenter must
also be secured to start to work by midnight on
the starting track; these things arranged for, the
two amateurs agreed that, together, they could
have the aeroplane itself so far set up by daylight
as to give assurance to the fair directors that the
day’s program could be carried out.</p>

<p>“And then,” suggested Lafe, “I suppose T.
Glenn Dare will sail in on the noon train and
steal our thunder.”</p>

<p>“He can’t steal mine,” laughed Bud. “I’ll
have been through this thing by that time from
top to bottom. That’s all I want—that, I can
get,” he added with another laugh.</p>

<p>The first stumbling block was the launching
device. This essential part of any aeroplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
flight is usually a single wooden rail about eight
inches high, faced with strap iron. As it is
necessary with most modern aeroplanes to make
a run before sufficient sustention is secured to
force the machine into the air, it is evident that
this starting impulse must be secured through an
outside force.</p>

<p>The specifications forwarded with the airship
purchased by the fair authorities, called for the
long wooden rail. On this the aeroplane was to
be balanced on a small two-wheeled truck. At the
rear end of the rail, the plans called for a small
derrick, pyramidal in form, constructed of four
timbers each twenty-five feet long and two inches
square braced by horizontal frames and wire
stays.</p>

<p>At the top and at the bottom of this, were two,
pulley blocks with a rope passing around the
sheaves a sufficient number of times to provide a
three-to-one relation between a 1500-pound
weight suspended from the top pulley and the
movement of the aeroplane on the track.</p>

<p>The rope, which passes around the pulley at
the bottom of the derrick, is carried forward to
and around a pulley at the front end of the rail,
and thence back to the aeroplane, to which it is
attached with a right-angled hook. When everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
is ready for an ascension and the operator
is in place, the propellers are set to work. When
they have reached their maximum revolution and
the car begins to feel their propelling force, the
weight, usually several bags of sand, is released,
the tightened rope shoots through the pulleys
and the balanced aeroplane springs forward on
its car. By the time it has traveled seventy-five
or one hundred feet, the impulse of the falling
weight and the lift of the propellers sends it
soaring. Thereupon, the hook drops off and the
free airship begins its flight.</p>

<p>“We have the plans for the derrick and the
track, the pulley blocks, rope and hook,” declared
Bud at once. “But we haven’t the little
car.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we make one?” ventured Lafe.</p>

<p>“Certainly, but hardly in the time we have.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of aeroplanes ascending by skidding
along over the grass,” suggested the bank
clerk.</p>

<p>“But they weren’t in the hands of amateurs.
We’d better stick to the rail. I’ve been thinking
over this—down there in the freight-house.”</p>

<p>“Did you know the track car wasn’t here?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t see it. Here is the idea. The
aeroplane has two light, smooth landing runners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
or skids. Lumber is cheap. Instead of a track for
the wheels we haven’t got, we’ll make two
grooves just as long as the proposed track.
We’ll stake these out on the ground and set the
landing runners in them after we’ve greased the
grooves with tallow. The weight, rope and hook
will work exactly as if we had a single track—’n
possibly better. Anything the matter with that
suggestion?”</p>

<p>Lafe was skeptical a few moments while Bud
made a sketch of the new device. Then he conceded
that he could see no reason why it wouldn’t
work.</p>

<p>“All right,” exclaimed Bud, in a businesslike
way, “now, you go ahead, and I’m off for town
for the timber and the men we need. You can’t
do much single handed, of course, but do what
you can. I’ll be back before midnight. Then
we’ll get down to business.”</p>

<p>The boy had no vehicle to carry him the two
miles to Scottsville, so he walked. The night
was dark, and almost starless, and the pike or
road was soft with heavy dust; but, with his coat
on his arm, Bud struck out with the stride of a
Weston. Covered with dust and perspiration,
in about half an hour, he reached the edge of the
town. Entering the first open place he found, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
sort of neighborhood grocery, he called up Mr.
Elder by telephone.</p>

<p>It required some minutes to fully explain the
situation, but finally he convinced the fair official
that the things he suggested were absolutely
necessary and must be done at once. As a result,
by the time Bud reached the town public square,
Mr. Elder was waiting for him in the office of the
hotel.</p>

<p>The usual “fair week” theatrical entertainment
was in progress in the town “opera-house,”
fakers were orating beneath their street torches,
and the square was alive with Scottsville citizens
and those already arrived for the fair. It was
not difficult for President Elder to start things
moving. Within a half hour he had found, and
for extra pay, arranged for two carpenters and
an engineer to report at the fair-grounds at once.</p>

<p>The securing of the lumber was not so easy
and called for some persistent telephoning. Finally
an employe of the “Hoosier Sash, Door and
Blind Co.” was found, and he in turn secured a
teamster. At ten-thirty o’clock, Bud was in the
lumber yard selecting the needed material with
the aid of a smoky lantern, and before eleven
o’clock the one-horse wagon was on its way to
the fair-grounds. The two carpenters reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the airship shed about eleven-thirty in a spring
wagon with their tools, and a little after twelve
o’clock the engineer arrived on foot with a hammer,
a wrench and a punch in his pocket.</p>

<p>Before work really began, Bud startled Pennington
with a cheery question.</p>

<p>“Say, Lafe, I’m hungry as a chicken, and
I’ve only got a dime. Got any money?”</p>

<p>Lafe was not celebrated for generosity.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what good money’ll do out here.
There’s no place to buy stuff. And it’s midnight
anyway.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll produce, I’ll get something to
eat,” said Bud with a grin.</p>

<p>“Here’s a quarter,” answered Pennington
slowly.</p>

<p>“Gimme a dollar,” exclaimed Bud. “I’ll pay
it back. I forgot to speak of it to Mr. Elder.”</p>

<p>“What do you want with a dollar?” asked his
associate, somewhat alarmed. Bud’s credit
wasn’t the sort that would ordinarily warrant
such a loan.</p>

<p>“Why, for all of us, of course. We can’t
work all night on empty stomachs. And there’s
five of us.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, Lafe rose to the occasion and
handed Bud a two-dollar bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can bring me the change,” he suggested
promptly. “I’ll charge it up to the fair officers.”</p>

<p>Bud was off in the dark. His hopes of securing
something to eat were based on what he had
seen passing through the grounds on his way
back with the lumber. In several groups under
the big trees, he had seen camp-fires. “Concession”
owners and their attendants who remained
on the grounds during the night had
turned the vicinity of the silent tents and booths
into a lively camp. In one place, the proprietor
of a “red hot” stand had a bed of charcoal glowing,
and a supply of toasting sausages on the
grill. These were in apparently steady demand
by watchmen, hostlers, live stock owners and
many others who had not yet retired.</p>

<p>On his way to this stand, Bud passed what he
had not observed before. In the rear of a dirty,
small tent, an old woman, a man and a woman
of middle age were squatted about the dying
embers of a fire. Almost concealing both the
tent and group was a painted picture, worn and
dingy, displayed like a side-show canvas. On
this, above the attempt to outline an Egyptian
female head, were the words: “Madame Zecatacas,
Gypsy Queen. The Future Revealed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54-<br />55]</a></span></p>

<p>Bud could not resist the temptation to stop a
moment. The man greeted him with a stare,
but the old woman held out a skinny hand. Her
brown, wrinkled face was almost repulsive. A
red and yellow handkerchief was wound around
her head, and her oily, thin black hair was
twisted into tight braids behind her ears, from
which hung long, brassy-looking earrings. In
spite of her age, she was neither bent nor feeble.</p>

<p>As the low fire played on the gaudy colors of
her thick dress, she leaned forward, her hand still
extended.</p>

<p>“Twelve o’clock, the good-luck hour,” she exclaimed
in a broken voice. “I see good fortune
in store for the young gentleman. Let the Gypsy
Queen read your fate. Cross Zecatacas’ palm
with silver. I see good fortune for the young
gentleman.”</p>

<p>There was something uncanny in the surroundings,
and Bud was about to beat a retreat, when
the man exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Got a cigarette, Kid?”</p>

<p>In explaining that he had not, Bud’s eyes fell
on the rest of the group. A little girl lay asleep
with her head in the middle-aged woman’s lap.
The man held a tin cup in his hand. On the
coals of the fire stood a coffee pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Got some coffee, there?” asked Bud
abruptly.</p>

<p>The man grunted in the negative. The old
woman punched the coals into a blaze.</p>

<p>“Give you fifty cents, if you’ll make me a pot
full,” said Bud.</p>

<p>The little girl’s mother looked up with interest.</p>

<p>“What kind o’ money?” drawled the man.</p>

<p>“Part of this,” said Bud displaying Lafe’s
two-dollar bill.</p>

<p>The man reached out his hand.</p>

<p>“Got the change?” Bud inquired.</p>

<p>The old woman reached under her dress and
withdrew her hand with a bag of silver coin.</p>

<p>“We’re over in the track working on the airship,”
explained Bud with no little pride.
“When it’s ready bring it over. You can see the
aeroplane.”</p>

<p>In the matter of food, Bud secured not only
“red hots,” sandwiches and dill pickles, but a
few cheese and ham sandwiches. Altogether he
expended a dollar and twenty-five cents of Lafe’s
money.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” he exclaimed on his return,
while the new workmen grinned and chuckled,
“hot dogs and ham on the bun. Coffee’ll be here
in a few minutes.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>MADAME ZECATACAS READS THE FUTURE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The workmen assisting Lafe and Bud did not
wait for the coffee. The last of the appetizing
sandwiches had disappeared when the male
member of Madame Zecatacas’ outfit came
shambling along with the pot of neither very
fragrant nor very strong coffee.</p>

<p>“Help yourselves, boys,” suggested Bud, offering
the workmen their only drinking vessel—a
tin water cup. “We’ll try to have a better
breakfast.”</p>

<p>Lafe, who had worked steadily and energetically
all night, was sitting on a box taking a
breathing spell. Bud, as a further reward to
the coffee bearer, was attempting to show the
sour-looking stranger some details of the aeroplane
and hastening in his explanation, for there
was plenty of work to be done. About the time
he had finished, there was a sharp exclamation
just outside the shed.</p>

<p>“Move on. What are you doing hanging
around here?”</p>

<p>It was Pennington speaking in a brusque voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Twelve o’clock, the good-luck hour,” a woman’s
voice responded. “I see good fortune in
store for the young gentleman. Let the Gypsy
Queen read your fate. Cross Zecatacas’ palm
with silver. I see good fortune for the young
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Get out, you faker,” exclaimed Lafe.</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” interrupted Bud. “She’s
the Gypsy Queen. She’s Queen Zecatacas,
and she made the coffee for us.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s no good anyway,” retorted Lafe.
“And I reckon we’ve had enough visitors for one
day.”</p>

<p>The old woman seemed not to hear the words.
She was looking beyond Pennington and into the
brilliantly lighted airship house, where, in the
glare of the torches and lanterns, the fragile and
graceful frame of the aeroplane had at last assumed
shape.</p>

<p>“Beat it,” added Lafe authoritatively, “and
don’t bother us any more. We’re busy.”</p>

<p>The aged gypsy did not take her eyes from the
skeleton of the airship. To Bud, the shadowed
fortune teller seemed like a person in a trance.
Without replying to Lafe or moving, she spoke,
suddenly, in a strange tongue, to the man with
her. He answered angrily in the same language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
She stretched forth a bare, lean arm and pointing
toward the aeroplane spoke again. The man
replied, more at length this time, and as if in
explanation.</p>

<p>“She wants to know what it’s all about,” volunteered
one of the carpenters who was nearest
the apparently transfixed woman.</p>

<p>The man laughed with a sort of sneer.</p>

<p>“Don’t you fool yourself. She reads. She
knows. But she never seen one.”</p>

<p>“Well, we ain’t on exhibition now,” spoke up
Lafe. “You and the old lady have your pay.
We’ll excuse you.”</p>

<p>“What you so sore about, Lafe?” interrupted
Bud. “I don’t see that they’re doin’ any harm.
I think we ought to thank ’em for makin’ us a
pot of coffee at midnight.”</p>

<p>Before Pennington could make reply to this,
Zecatacas, the Queen of the Gypsies, took a
step forward. Something seemed to make her
look bigger—perhaps it was the light, which now
fell full on her face. Bud stepped back. It was a
face full of creepy power. Chanting, the woman
spread her long fingers before her and mumbled:</p>

<p>“The old Gypsy Queen has read the Book of
Fate many years. Across the seas, she foretold
how man would soar like a bird. What she foretold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
has come to pass. Not for gold nor silver did
the Book of the Future open to her. She dreamed
the dream of what would come to pass. To-morrow
Zecatacas will look upon what she foretold
across the seas.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” interrupted Bud, anxious to change
the subject, “come to me, and I’ll get you a front
seat—free. When did you predict that there’d
be airships?”</p>

<p>“Rubbish,” exclaimed Lafe, glaring at the
old fortune teller. “If you feel better now,
you’d better duck and get to bed.”</p>

<p>To neither of these speeches did the gypsy
seem to give the slightest heed.</p>

<p>“What is written in the Book of the Future
will be. I see men flying over forest and mountain.
Faster than birds they mount into the
clouds. The clouds are dark, the sky is black.
I see—the Gypsy Queen sees death.”</p>

<p>“Get out, you old hag,” roared Lafe, angered
at last beyond control, “or I’ll fire you out.”</p>

<p>With a cat-like spring, the gypsy leaped forward,
caught Lafe’s extended arm in a vice-like
grip, and before the young man knew what she
was doing, or could prevent it, she had opened
his clenched fist and shot a lightning-like glance
at his exposed palm. As the half frightened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
trembling Lafe jerked his hand from her grasp,
the fortune teller hissed at him:</p>

<p>“You spit upon the Gypsy Queen. She puts
upon you no curse. But the Line of Fate tells
much. Beware! Zecatacas tells nothing. For
him who spits upon her, she sees all evil and
woe. There is more, the sky is black, but old
Zecatacas tells nothing. Beware!”</p>

<p>With the last word, the old woman disappeared
into the darkness. Before Lafe could make reply
to her, the man, picking up his coffee pot,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I was just goin’ to hand you a swipe for your
freshness, young fellow, but I guess the old woman
has given you enough to think about.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” blurted out Lafe, making
a show of resentment and swaggering up to
the man. The latter reached out a brawny hand
and pushed Pennington aside.</p>

<p>“I mean what I said. I ain’t no Romney. But,
I don’t cross the old lady. She ain’t handin’ out
no hoodoo curses; but—well, the long and short
of it is, she’s got her fingers crossed on you.
Them gypsies has sure got somethin’ up their
sleeves we ain’t an’, whatever it is, I wouldn’t
give you a nickel for your luck while she’s sore
on you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he too was gone. The same talkative carpenter,
for all had suspended work while the incident
was taking place, felt called upon to make
a remark.</p>

<p>“I knowed a Gypsy ’at put a charm on a feller
I worked with onct an’ he fell off’n a roof an’
purt nigh kilt hisself.”</p>

<p>“And I heard of a colored voodoo doctor,”
broke in Bud, “who put a curse on a coon, and
the doctor himself was arrested for chicken
stealin’. So you see there ain’t much to be scared
about.” He attempted to liven things with a
peal of laughter. But no one joined him. “And
as for this old Zecatacas, or Gypsy Queen as she
calls herself,” he went on, “she makes me tired.
Give ’em a quarter and you’re goin’ to have
good luck and money; turn ’em down, as Lafe
kind o’ had to do, an’ they make an awful bluff
about doin’ you dirt some way.”</p>

<p>“She don’t scare me a bit,” remarked Pennington,
who was yet white and trembling.</p>

<p>“You’d be a fool if she did,” added Bud consolingly.
“Any way, it’s all over now. Let’s
fall to and get busy.”</p>

<p>Pennington had already worked nine hours,
and it was not strange that he was tired and nervous.
He was restless and irritable, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
now and then took occasion to say how little he
cared for old Zecatacas’ words. Bud did what
he could to belittle the gypsy’s disturbing
speech. At three o’clock, Lafe lay down and
slept until six, when he, Bud and the three men
closed the shed and, on another advance from
Lafe, managed to secure an early breakfast at a
boarding tent erected for the stock attendants.
Newly fortified with food and a wash up, they
were back to work at seven o’clock.</p>

<p>Pennington had grown a little more affable,
and as the end of their labors now came in sight,
he was even at times in a good humor. But Bud
saw that either old Zecatacas’ speech or something
else disturbed Lafe. At eight o’clock,
when President Elder arrived, it was seen that,
whether expert Dare arrived or not, the aeroplane
would be ready by about eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>“How did you young fellows settle it?” were
Mr. Elder’s first words, after a gratified look
into the airship shed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pennington has it,” answered Bud
promptly.</p>

<p>“No hard feelings?” added the official with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Smooth as pie,” explained Bud. “Only, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the chance ever comes, I’d like a try at it—when
I ain’t in any one’s way.”</p>

<p>“Still think you can sail her?” said Mr. Elder,
turning to Pennington.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the latter, “it looks easy
enough. Of course, there is a certain risk, but
I’ll chance that. Only,” and he spoke as if
the thought had just come to him, “I wish I’d
had more rest last night. I’m pretty tired, and
you know a fellow ought to be at his best.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” explained Bud, “he worked a good
deal longer than the rest of us.” He didn’t
say anything, however, about Pennington’s
three hours’ sleep. “Of course, he feels it more.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better wait until to-morrow,
Lafe, when you’ve had a good night’s sleep.
How would it do for Bud to make the first trial?
He seems fresh enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right—I guess,” answered Pennington.
“You can count on me. By the way,
you didn’t hear from Mr. Dare, did you?”</p>

<p>“Not a peep.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready.”</p>

<p>Before nine o’clock, two more directors appeared,
almost together. They were Lafe’s
father, Judge E. Pennington (in reality only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Justice of the Peace), and Bud’s foster father,
Attorney Cyrus Stockwell.</p>

<p>“Bud,” began Attorney Stockwell angrily,
“why didn’t you send us word you were going
to stay out all night?”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” answered Bud without
any great alarm, “I didn’t know it when
I left home, and after I got out here, I didn’t
have a chance.”</p>

<p>“They tell me you offered to go up in this
thing,” continued the attorney, jerking his
thumb toward the now practically completed air
craft.</p>

<p>“Offered!” exclaimed Bud. “I begged to.
But I got left. Lafe beat me to it.”</p>

<p>“Lafe?” exclaimed Judge Pennington. “Lafe
going up in the airship?”</p>

<p>“I agreed to,” exclaimed young Pennington.
“If the operator don’t come, they’ve got to
have some one. And I know more about it than
any one else around here.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve promised to commit suicide in
that death trap?” added Judge Pennington
hastily.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t see what else I could do,” faltered
Lafe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I can,” broke in his father, “and
mighty quick. You can stay out of it.”</p>

<p>“Judge,” interrupted Attorney Stockwell,
“I don’t see any cause to worry. Bud tells me
he is anxious to take Lafe’s place.”</p>

<p>“Bud Wilson?” sneered the Judge. “What
call has he to try such a thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, none, except he’s been up in one once.
I never heard that Lafe had,” retorted the piqued
lawyer. Attorney Stockwell had no particular
concern for Bud and certainly no affection for
him. Later, Judge Pennington said he reckoned
the lawyer rather wanted Bud to turn aviator
and break his neck in the bargain. But, this
morning, the lawyer resented Lafe’s superiority.</p>

<p>“I guess if Lafe had tried to fly, he wouldn’t
have tumbled out on his head,” snorted the
Judge. “I don’t approve of sending boys up
just because we made this fool arrangement.
But, when it comes down to who’s entitled to do
the thing and who’s got the real grit, I guess
it’ll be my own boy.”</p>

<p>Bud was watching Lafe. He expected to see
his rival swell up with pride and elation. On
the contrary, he was sure that he detected signs
of disappointment in young Pennington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“He don’t seem to be hankerin’ after the
job,” was the attorney’s next shot.</p>

<p>“Lafe,” exclaimed his father belligerently,
“did Mr. Elder select you for this work?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“Then you do the job, or I’ll know why.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was all settled,” interposed Bud
in a calm voice. “I ain’t makin’ any fuss about
it. I ain’t claimin’ the right.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t be disappointed,” snapped
the judge, and he bustled angrily away.</p>

<p>“Bud?” asked the Attorney in a low voice,
as Lafe walked away, “how much are you to
get for workin’ all night?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent. It’s like goin’ to school to me.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy. Workin’ all night for
nothin’? Why that’s expert service, an’ it
ought to be double pay, too.”</p>

<p>“I did it for fun,” explained Bud, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Fun?” snapped the lawyer. “You wouldn’t
think it so funny if you had to pay for your
board and clothes.”</p>

<p>“I never asked you to do either,” replied Bud.
“I don’t know why you do. You just took me
in. If you’re tired of me, I’ll stay away. But
I haven’t any money to pay you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stay away,” sneered the lawyer. “Where’d
you stay? You haven’t a home.”</p>

<p>“Wherever there’s aeroplanes,” answered
Bud calmly, “that’s my job now.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said the Attorney in a milder tone,
“I don’t want to be hard on you. You had better
come back to us until you are able to care for
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Bud. “I hope that
won’t be long.”</p>

<p>When his foster father had followed after
Judge Pennington, Bud turned to Lafe. The latter
was lying on a long packing case.</p>

<p>“Sleepy?” asked Bud.</p>

<p>“Pretty tired,” replied Lafe. “Do you think
you can finish up now? I believe I ought to go
home and go to bed for an hour or so before afternoon.
I’ve got to be on edge, you know.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Bud sympathetically. “You do
that. I’ll put the last touches on everything.
If you get back here by two o’clock, that’s time
enough?”</p>

<p>Just before twelve o’clock, President Elder
drove up to the airship shed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he announced, “he didn’t come. Our
expert failed to arrive. It’s up to Lafe. Where
is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’ll be here,” answered Bud. “We’re
all ready, and he’s gone home for a little rest.”</p>

<p>About one-thirty o’clock, President Elder visited
the aeroplane headquarters again. Bud was
greasing the starting grooves.</p>

<p>“Bud,” began the fair official with a faint
smile, “I knew it all the time. It’s you or no
exhibition. Lafe Pennington is in bed, sick.
He’s got a nervous chill.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE GYPSY QUEEN’S TALISMAN.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Thursday and Friday were usually the big
days at the fair in point of attendance; but, owing
no doubt to the novel exhibition so widely advertised
to begin this day, long before noon it
was apparent that the directors had made a wise
investment when they spent eighteen hundred
dollars for an aeroplane. The pike leading to
the fair-ground lay beneath a cloud of dust, the
hitch racks were full, and, on the basis of number
of visitors, the exhibition was really in full
blast a day ahead of time.</p>

<p>The last touches were hastily put on the exhibits
in the Agricultural, Floral and Machinery
Halls; the ice cream, candy, peanut and red
lemonade stands made a brave show of their
wares; the “nigger baby” and cane rack barkers
began appealing to young and old alike to try
their luck, and by noon, thousands of pushing,
tired and perspiring people attested that the fair
was already in full swing.</p>

<p>The “three minute” trot and “free for all”
running races were carded for the afternoon, beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
at two o’clock; and the big event, the
startling, stupendous and spectacular flight of
the “Twentieth Century Marvel,” the aeroplane,
was to occur about three o’clock between heats
of the races.</p>

<p>The curious spectators did not bother themselves
about the airship until after the dinner
hour. But, just about the time President Elder
announced to Bud that Lafe would not be able to
operate the airship, the crowd began to drift
toward the field within the race track. By two
o’clock, the pressure became so great that Bud,
the talkative carpenter who was yet with him,
and a special policeman detailed by Superintendent
Perry, were forced to drop the canvas side
over the front of the house, and devote their
time to protecting the starting track or rails.</p>

<p>When the carpenter learned that Lafe was sick
and would be unable to direct the flight, he did
not hesitate to express his opinion.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he exclaimed. “I guess he’s
sick, all right. And he began gettin’ sick right
after that old Gypsy spoke her piece. I don’t
blame him, neither.”</p>

<p>“What’d you mean?” asked Bud, apparently
surprised. “You don’t mean the old woman
scared him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“She nigh scart me. You bet she did. Mr.
Pennington ain’t sick o’ overwork. The Gypsy
Queen jes’ nacherly scart him into a chill.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Bud. “He may be
scared—I rather thought myself he was weakenin’
this morning, but he’d be a fool to let a
woman put over such a bluff.”</p>

<p>The carpenter shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know no law agin’ his bein’ a fool,”
he added.</p>

<p>Bud made no answer. He knew well enough
that the carpenter’s theory was right. Whether
Lafe had the physical courage to trust himself
in the aeroplane Bud had no way of knowing.
But his own eyes told him that Pennington had
not the moral courage to throw off the prophecy
of Zecatacas, the Gypsy Queen. In his heart, he
felt sorry for Lafe, for he himself had a most distinct
and disagreeable recollection of the Gypsy’s
depressing prediction.</p>

<p>The first thump of horses’ feet on the race
track when the “three minute” trotters came
out to warm up and the “ding,” “ding,”
“ding,” of the warning bell in the judges’ stand
took away a part of the crowd, but enough remained
to put the starting track in constant danger.
Finally, Bud managed to secure a long rope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and the carpenter staked off a pen in front of the
shed. This protected the apparatus, but it made
Bud conspicuous, and the crowd began to hail
comment on him.</p>

<p>“Hey, there, Bud Wilson,” shouted a young
man. “They’re a givin’ it out over yender that
you’re goin’ up in the airship.”</p>

<p>Bud smiled and nodded his head. The crowd
pushed forward.</p>

<p>“I reckon yer likely to come down right smart
faster nor ye go up,” exclaimed a rural humorist.</p>

<p>“Not none o’ thet in mine,” added another
voice. “Not fur love nur money.”</p>

<p>“What won’t they be a doin’ nex?” exclaimed
a fourth.</p>

<p>Bud smiled and said nothing. But, just at
this time, seeing a familiar figure in the crowd,
he sprang forward, lifted the rope and beckoned
Madame Zecatacas, the Gypsy Queen, to come
inside. She did so, and, while a hubbub of protest
and inquiry arose from the crowd, Bud led
the picturesquely bedecked fortune teller to the
airship shed, lifted the canvas flap and signed
to her to enter. The old woman had now none
of the creepy, malignant look she exhibited the
night before. She was rather fawning than
otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look a’ here, Madame Zecatacas,” Bud began
at once. “I reckon you don’t know what a
commotion you made last night. They say you
scared my friend sick.”</p>

<p>“The Gypsy Queen sees all things—knows
all,” began the old woman in her usual singsong.
“He who spits on—”</p>

<p>“Oh, see here,” interrupted Bud. “He didn’t
spit on you, and didn’t mean anything agin’
you. You’re a little touchy ain’t you?”</p>

<p>Madame Zecatacas gave him something like
the look she gave Lafe the night before. Then
her face relaxed into a smile. She ignored the
question.</p>

<p>“The young gentleman has a good hand.
Money, and the Gypsy Queen will bring him good
fortune.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got but ten cents,” laughed Bud.</p>

<p>The Gypsy scowled.</p>

<p>“Here,” he exclaimed hastily. “Don’t begin
that with me. Don’t put any high sign on me.
I ain’t got time to have a chill.”</p>

<p>“The Gypsy Queen can do much.”</p>

<p>“I can see that, good enough,” answered Bud
promptly, thinking of Lafe, “but I haven’t the
price. If I had, I’d try you a whirl. I never
had my fortune told. See here, Mrs. Zecatacas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
what do I get for lettin’ you in here free gratis
for nothin’? Right next the airship, too? I’d
think you’d tell me a few good things just to
show there’s no hard feelin’.”</p>

<p>The Gypsy tried to scowl again, but Bud’s
exuberance was too much for her. She reached
forward and took his hand.</p>

<p>“Look out now,” urged Bud. “Nothin’ bum.
Don’t give me the willies. I got to do my flyin’
stunt in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Long life,” began the Gypsy.</p>

<p>“Bully for you,” exclaimed Bud. “Now, just
tell me I’ll get an education and travel, and have
money enough to buy an aeroplane, and we’ll
call it square.”</p>

<p>“And much trouble—”</p>

<p>“Shut her off,” interrupted the boy, with assumed
concern. “Come to think of it, I don’t
need my fortune read. I’m goin’ to make my
own.”</p>

<p>“A strange man will bring you much trouble—”</p>

<p>“Beware of a dark stranger,” laughed Bud.
“That’s all right, Mrs. Zecatacas, I’ll watch for
him. Now, I’ll show you around a bit and then
I guess you’d better be going.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes, Bud explained, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
he could, the general features of the aeroplane.
In the midst of this, he heard animated talk just
outside the canvas door, and, as it was quickly
thrown aside, the Scottsville Chief of Police,
Matthew Marsh, or Mat Marsh, as he was universally
known, stepped inside the tent.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bud,” he began. “Heard you was in
charge here. An’ got company, too. Don’t
want to make no disturbance, but I’m lookin’
fur your friend.” He looked at Madame Zecatacas,
and motioned her toward him. “I want
you,” he added officially. “I got a warrant for
you.”</p>

<p>The old woman gazed at him in astonishment,
and then appealingly at Bud.</p>

<p>“Got a warrant for her!” exclaimed the boy.
“What for?”</p>

<p>“Assault and battery,” answered Chief
Marsh laconically.</p>

<p>“Who’s she assaulted?”</p>

<p>“Judge Pennington issued it on complaint o’
his boy.”</p>

<p>“Lafe?”</p>

<p>“Yep. Lafe says the old lady jumped on him
las’ night and assaulted him. Guess it’s right.
He’s home in bed.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie,” retorted Bud angrily, “and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
don’t believe Lafe ever said so. I saw it all.
It’s a lie.”</p>

<p>“You seen it?” commented the Chief.</p>

<p>“All of it—right here. But there wasn’t any
fight. Nothin’ like it.”</p>

<p>“I reckon the old lady and her son-in-law better
subpoena you fur a witness.”</p>

<p>“Has the man been arrested, too?”</p>

<p>The Chief nodded his head.</p>

<p>“When’s the trial?” asked Bud indignantly.</p>

<p>This time, the Chief shook his head the other
way.</p>

<p>“You let me know,” exclaimed Bud. “I’m
beginnin’ to get onto this deal. I want to be
there and testify. These people didn’t do a thing
out of the way. There’s four of us’ll swear to
it. This is Judge Pennington’s doings.”</p>

<p>The Chief wiped his perspiring bald head.</p>

<p>“How do ye figure that?” he said at last.</p>

<p>Bud was silent a few moments, and in each one
of these he became more angry. Finally, he
burst out in his indignation.</p>

<p>“I ain’t blamin’ Lafe,” he said, “but he
talked pretty raw to Mrs. Zecatacas last night,
and she handed it right back. An’ gypsy-like she
talked about hard luck and trouble and things
like that ’til Lafe kind o’ got cold feet on reskin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
anything to-day. That’s what I think anyway.
Now he’s home in bed, sick or scared or both.
An’ when he told his father about what took
place out here, the Judge didn’t do a thing but
fake up this complaint just to get even. He’s
sore because I’ve got the chance an’ Lafe ain’t.
I didn’t expect to do no knockin’, but that’s
just the way it’ll all figure out. You can
take it right straight from me.”</p>

<p>The Chief looked knowingly at Bud, and then
closed one eye.</p>

<p>“Bein’ an officer o’ the law, I ain’t takin’
sides an’ I don’t have no opinion. But I heerd
what you said. Come on, old lady.”</p>

<p>Madame Zecatacas straightened up and glared
at the policeman. Bud stepped over and patted
her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“You can’t get out of it—now—Mrs. Zecatacas.
Go along quietly, and if you want me for
a witness or any of the men who were here last
night, you tell Mr. Marsh. I’ll come and testify
for you.”</p>

<p>The gypsy caught his hands in hers, pressed
them, and then with a swift movement laid two
brown fingers on Bud’s forehead. With another
swift motion, she pointed to the aeroplane and
exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Gypsy Queen gives you good luck.”</p>

<p>This happened in an instant, but before Bud
could recover from his surprise, the withered
dame reached forth her hand once more, and
forced into Bud’s palm a small object. Then,
without further word, she followed the Chief of
Police.</p>

<p>In his fingers, Bud found a heavy ring—dull
of color, and yet, apparently not brass. Sunk in
the top of it, was a worn, opaque, green stone
in the shape of a bug. Bud did not know it, but
the stone was a sacred Egyptian scarab.</p>

<p>“Good luck from the Gypsy Queen,” repeated
Bud, a little upset. “Well, anyway, good or bad,
here goes,” and he slipped the worn ring upon
his third finger.</p>

<p>Outside the shed, Bud found the waiting crowd
almost too much for the men on guard, with a
new stream thronging toward the aviation
grounds from the race-track. At the head of
this, marched President Elder, Superintendent
Perry and the other officials. Bud knew his
part of the day’s program was due. He glanced
skyward. There was almost no breeze.</p>

<p>“Everything ready?” asked Mr. Elder, in
a quick businesslike tone. “It’s just been announced
from the judges’ stand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ought to hear ’em yell when I told ’em how
Mr. Bud Wilson, a product of our own city,
would operate the machine,” added the Superintendent.</p>

<p>Bud was too busy to parry personal compliments.
While Superintendent Perry and the
President lifted the canvas front and drove the
crowd back, Bud tested the ignition battery, re-oiled
the shaft bearings, looked a last time for
possible leaks in the gasoline reservoir and then
for an instant only, set the engine in motion.
As it stopped and the vibrating frame settled
back on its trusses, he knew of nothing more to
be done.</p>

<p>Outside he could hear the President and the
Superintendent shouting commands and exhortations.</p>

<p>“Git back there, now, all o’ you, ’at don’t
want to git hurt. Mr. Wilson’s got to have
room. Anybody ’at gits hit’ll be killed. Git
back there, everybody. You can all see. ’Taint
no horse race. Stand back! The aeroplane will
circle around the track. You kin all see. Give
us room here,” the superintendent kept crying.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” added President
Elder, mounting the lower brace of the weight
derrick. “It is only proper for me to announce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
once more that we are only able to make this
exhibition to-day through the kindness of a
Scottsville boy, Mr. Bud Wilson. The expert
who was to operate our aeroplane disappointed
us. But, rather than disappoint you, Mr. Wilson
has volunteered to risk his life in exhibiting this
wonderful invention. I hope you will help him
by giving us ample room, and that you will refrain
from rushing forward, if there happens to
be an accident. We must have no interference,
and, on behalf of Mr. Wilson, I ask absolute silence
while he is adjusting the aeroplane for its
hazardous plunge into space.”</p>

<p>A murmur ran through the crowd which, in a
moment, died away into an awed silence. The
speech and the silence that fell immediately upon
the thousands present attracted Bud’s attention.
He turned from his lingering look at the craft
that meant so much to him just in time to find
President Elder motioning to him. He stepped
to the official’s side. As he did so, Mr. Elder
sprang from the derrick and laid his hand on
Bud’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” shouted the president
in a voice that could be heard at the far
edge of the expectant jam, “I take great pleasure
in presenting to you Mr. Bud Wilson, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
aviator. Good luck and success to you, Bud,”
he added, melodramatically taking the boy’s
hand.</p>

<p>A woman in the crowd sobbed and Bud, red
with embarrassment, hastened into the shed.</p>

<p>“What’d you do that for?” exclaimed Bud,
as the President joined him.</p>

<p>“Do what?” laughed Mr. Elder.</p>

<p>“Why shake hands that way and say that. I
ain’t no circus.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” answered the fair official.
“That’s just what you are. This is a show.
And we want to make it worth our eighteen
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>

<p>“And that isn’t all. The real performance is
yet to come. You don’t suppose you’re just
going to shoot away in silence. Did you ever see
’em ‘loop the loop’ in a circus? Well, we’ve got
that beat a mile. Listen. I’ll release the weight
that starts you. When you are ready to get into
the car, I’ll get up and tell ’em that any sound
may distract you and cause a fatal accident.
When they are absolutely still, you’ll take your
seat and I’ll take my place at the weight cord.
Then I’ll say in a solemn voice: ‘When you are
ready, Mr. Wilson, say Go.’ You’ll look about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
settle yourself, wait a few moments and then,
sharp and quick, shout ‘Go!’ Then if you do go,
the crowd’ll feel it has its twenty-five cents’
worth.”</p>

<p>Bud laughed.</p>

<p>“Funny you didn’t bring a pair of tights,”
he commented.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>A FOOLHARDY TRICK IN AN AEROPLANE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For one moment, a feeling of doubt swept over
Bud—not fear of an accident—it was only the
first dread of all amateurs—apprehension that
his performance might not go off all right. When
he glanced out over the thousands waiting to see
what was he going to do and realized that all
these people were waiting for him—it was
enough to give a youngster stage fright. While
he paused, he felt Madame Zecatacas’ ring, her
good luck charm.</p>

<p>“What more does a fellow need?” Bud said to
himself. “All ready,” he exclaimed aloud, suddenly
reassured, and springing to the center of
the aeroplane frame between the engine section
and the rear rudder struts, he directed the others
in the shed to places along the truss. Then as
gently as if moving a man with a broken leg, the
long, wiry white planes of the airship were carried
out into the full view of the crowd.</p>

<p>The “Ohs” and “Ahs” were soon lost in the
noise of the shuffling, eager audience. Men and
women crowded forward, clouds of dust arose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and the rope barrier broke before the clamoring
spectators. Those carrying the machine could
only call out threats until the aeroplane had
been deposited over the starting track and the
landing skids fitted into the greased grooves.
Then Bud sprang onto the fragile frame work.
Waving his hand at the people, he shouted:</p>

<p>“The aeroplane is going to shoot straight
along this track fast as an engine. If any of you
folks get in its way, you’ll be smashed. There
ain’t goin’ to be no start until you all get back
and stay back.”</p>

<p>Then he sprang to the ground and for five
minutes, he, the president, superintendent and
the others helping, struggled with the slowly
receding flood of people. At last the rope barrier
was re-established and Bud, hot and perspiring,
felt that the trial might be safely attempted.
As a precaution, he went into the
shed and put on his coat. This one act seemed to
calm the crowd.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to be cold up in the clouds?” inquired
one facetious onlooker.</p>

<p>For answer, Bud fastened the right-angled
hook attached to the end of the starting rope to
the lowest cross brace of the forward rudder
frame and then, with the help of the carpenter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and the superintendent, pushed the aeroplane
backward on the two tracks until the rope was
taut. The bags of sand weighing 1500 pounds
were already at the top of the derrick, and the
release cord was ready for President Elder’s
manipulation.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the program,” whispered that
official, as he stepped by Bud.</p>

<p>“I’ll go you one better,” answered the boy,
with a smile. Then, recalling what he had often
seen in circuses, Bud stepped a few paces forward
and looked the car over critically. This
was wholly for effect, but with a most concerned
face, the young aviator squinted at the ship of
the air from two or three angles. Then he
mounted the end of the starting rail and looked
critically into the sky, even holding up his hand
as if to test the air.</p>

<p>“Purty resky business,” volunteered one man
in the front line.</p>

<p>“Ain’t agoin’ to take no chances,” suggested
another.</p>

<p>Then, Bud ignoring, but drinking in with
great satisfaction these and many other nervous
comments, walked rapidly to the aeroplane, and,
with well assumed professional rapidity, felt and
shook several braces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon he knows what he’s about, all
right,” Bud heard some one say, and the boy,
losing his smile for a moment, wondered if he
did.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no use puttin’ it off longer,” he said
to himself, and he waved his hand toward the
fair president. Mr. Elder at once ascended to
the derrick cross brace, and removing his hat
with a flourish, shouted:</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Wilson announces
that all is ready for his daring flight into
the clouds. I must ask that each and every one
of you maintain complete silence. Any undue
noise may divert the attention of the operator
and the slightest disturbance may mean his instant
death.”</p>

<p>The mob seemed to sink back in awe. Bud
and President Elder were perhaps the only persons
present whose hearts were not, figuratively,
in their mouths. The bareheaded president
raised his hand. You might have heard a pin
drop.</p>

<p>“When you are ready, Mr. Wilson, say ‘Go.’”</p>

<p>Throwing on the ignition and giving the balance
wheel a turn, Bud saw the white propellers
begin to revolve. As they gathered speed and
the engine was fully in motion—the car beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to tremble under the impact—Bud sprang
into the little seat, thrust his feet into the hanging
supports and grasped the levers.</p>

<p>As his lips framed themselves to give the final
signal, a flying figure shot into his sight. A man
panting, and with his hat in his hand was rushing
across the cleared space closely pursued by
one of the special policemen. Hardly able to
speak, his arm wildly gesticulating, the new arrival
was shouting:</p>

<p>“Stop, stop. I just got here. What are you
doin’?”</p>

<p>“Get out o’ the way,” shouted Bud in reply.
“Get off that track.”</p>

<p>“I’m Dare,” panted the man. “Who’s tryin’
to run this? Stop!”</p>

<p>“Get off that track,” shouted Bud again.</p>

<p>“You’ll break your neck,” the breathless man
managed to get out. But he saw the car trembling
for the start, and he began moving aside.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Elder?” he cried. “Wait a
minute. I’ll make the flight. Hold on!”</p>

<p>“Go,” rang out from the boy in the aeroplane.</p>

<p>It came like a pistol shot, clear and distinct.
But President Elder at the weight rope hesitated.</p>

<p>“Go,” came once more.</p>

<p>There was a note of command in the one word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that startled the official. Whatever his judgment
was at the moment, President Elder mechanically
jerked the cord. With a crashing
creak of the derrick and a thud of falling sand
bags, the starting rope whipped over the pulleys;
there was a spray of melted tallow thrown fifty
feet into the air by the flying skids; five thousand
spectators gasped and fell back as if panic
stricken, and the aeroplane smoked forward as
if rushing into a vacuum.</p>

<p>Half way along the track, the rocking aeroplane
seemed to lose headway for an instant.
The pressure of the air in front and the force
of the propellers behind had equalled and overcome
the force of gravity. As the starting rope
hook fell from the frame, the two great planes,
like a kite in the wind, darted into a giant
leap ahead.</p>

<p>Hundreds of spectators, still lingering in the
path of the airship, threw themselves onto the
ground just in time. The aeroplane almost
touched the earth as the leap seemed to slacken,
but this Bud had been anticipating. He did not
know whether the first dart of the car would be
up or down, to the right or left. But he did know
that there was not one chance in a thousand
that the flight would be straight ahead and upward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
What professional aviators had learned
by long experience, Bud knew he had to get
by sheer cool headed pluck.</p>

<p>He had thought over this idea so constantly
that his muscles were set and ready like springs.
Not even the narrow escape of the people in front
of him rattled the boy. His body was cold from
a realization of the great risk he was taking,
but this did not disconcert him. When Bud
shouted the word that was to hurl him into the
air, he dismissed every thought from his mind
but this: “up, down, right, left.”</p>

<p>It was all done in a second, but Bud’s thinking
apparatus responded. “Down,” his whole
being cried out, and his muscles responded like
a spring. Almost before the boy could realize
what he was doing, he had thrown the front, horizontal
rudder up. In another instant he knew
he was going to fly; the ground dropped beneath
him, and then a tremendous roar sounded in his
ears. He gasped. But the sound was only the
wild cheers of the multitude beneath. He <em>was</em>
flying—the aeroplane was soaring swiftly upward.
It was like falling in a dream. With nervous
dread, the boy looked about. Then came
his third shock—the fair-grounds were already
behind him. He had passed beyond the territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in which he was to operate. He was at least
three hundred feet in the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly all fear, apprehension and nervousness
left Bud.</p>

<p>“It’s all over now,” he said to himself.
“These things don’t fall like rocks. If the engine
stops, I’ll come down like a parachute.
Here goes to do my stunt.”</p>

<p>A minute later, Bud was directing the aeroplane
along the back stretch of the race track
about one hundred and fifty feet above the
ground. It all seemed so easy that he wondered
why he had had any apprehension. In the midst
of a chorus of yells and hurrahs from the hundreds
who were vainly trying to keep pace with
the aeroplane, Bud at last heard one positive
voice:</p>

<p>“Get nearer the ground, you fool.”</p>

<p>The boy could not distinguish the man calling,
but he recognized the voice. It was that of the
stranger—the expert, T. Glenn Dare. So far,
Bud had not time to think over the sudden appearance
of the long waited for man. But he
smiled as the episode came back to him.</p>

<p>“That must have been the Gypsy Queen’s
ring,” he thought to himself. “Any way, I got
my chance. I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he wondered: “What will Mr. Dare do
when he makes a flight to-morrow. I wonder
if he’ll stay close to the ground. He’s only
jealous,” concluded Bud.</p>

<p>Prompted by that foolish idea and more than
eager to take full advantage of his opportunity,
the gritty boy decided that he was not satisfied—he
determined, on a wild impulse, to test the airship
to its limit.</p>

<p>Circling the half-mile track, he dropped down
nearer the ground as he passed the crowded
grand stand, but he was too intent on his work to
give any heed to the applause that greeted him.
The dusty track was packed with spectators
throwing their hats into the air and shouting:
“Let her out,” “Gimme a ride,” “Good boy,
Bud,” and such expressions rang in his ears,
but they did not draw even a smile.</p>

<p>Again, the wonderful craft, true to her steering
gear and responding to her propellers in the
almost dead calm, circled the track. But this
time, as Bud reached the lower turn, he veered
off to the left. As the inclined planes moved forward
toward the center of the track, Bud put
his indiscreet resolution into effect.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the far end of the track
he was five hundred feet in the air. Then, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of turning, he held his course beyond the
enclosure out over the adjoining fields and pastures.
Here, with a long sweep in the air, he
turned and headed over the grounds once more.
By the time he had passed the grand-stand again,
he was at least a thousand feet in the air.</p>

<p>At that moment, the boy began to regret his
foolhardiness. To turn at that height, with the
sinking swing that always followed such an operation,
was enough to try the nerve of the most
experienced. And, to make matters worse, Bud
perversely held to his ascending flight. When
the limits of the grounds had been again passed,
the novice was, it was afterwards estimated,
fourteen hundred feet in the air.</p>

<p>“Now,” muttered Bud, “it’s sink or swim.”</p>

<p>Closing his eyes, with one hand he threw the
vertical lever slowly over for the turn, and at
the same moment, he threw up the plane tips
with the warping lever. It was almost sickening,
the long swoop that followed, but, as Bud
felt the warped surface checking the dip, he
breathed again. Then he opened his eyes. The
airship shed fell on his vision dead ahead and not
far below.</p>

<p>Gritting his teeth to keep up his courage, the
youngster made ready to complete his program.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
As the aeroplane steadied, Bud pushed the horizontal
planes downward, and as the bird-like
craft began to descend, he turned and shut off
the engine.</p>

<p>“They say any one can fly,” said Bud to himself,
“but that it takes judgment to make a landing.
I’ll either make or break right here.”</p>

<p>As the swiftly whirling blades of the propellers
stopped, the aeroplane’s flight slackened.
Then the ivory-winged truss began to settle like
a softly falling leaf. A mass of black heads appeared
beneath. Suddenly, they separated, and
Bud saw the ground rising as if to meet him. It
was the crucial moment. The horizontal rudders
sprang up, the airship seemed to pause,
then with a feeble response to her steering gear,
it rose a few feet and drifted along over the
trodden grass. Then the landing skids touched
the ground—there was a slight rebound, and
Bud’s flight was at an end.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>AMATEUR VS. PROFESSIONAL.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Every one in the yelling, pushing crowd
seemed to be trying to get hold of the aeroplane.
But again the policemen forced the spectators
back and Bud saw, even before he alighted, and a
good deal to his disgust, that Mr. Dare seemed
to be in charge of the situation. As the young
aviator climbed from the frame, the professional
and President Elder confronted him:</p>

<p>“Young man,” said the former, in a very superior
tone, “you’re in luck to be alive. Haven’t
you any sense?”</p>

<p>Bud looked him over. The man was about
thirty-five years old, rather nattily dressed in
grey clothes, a blue scarf and a chauffeur’s cap.
Two or three sharp replies occurred to Bud, but
he suppressed them, and turned to Mr. Elder.
The latter walked into the tent, and motioned to
Bud to follow. Then the boy suddenly realized
that the fair president was trembling with anger.</p>

<p>“Bud,” he began at once, trying to be calm,
“didn’t I tell you what to do? Didn’t I give
you your program? Wasn’t you to fly three
times around the track and then come down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you don’t like it because I varied it a
little? Because I gave ’em a good run for their
money?”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder shook his finger before the boy’s
face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dare tells me it was one chance in a
thousand that you didn’t smash the machine.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t worry about my breaking my neck at
the same time, did he?” asked Bud with a smile.</p>

<p>“We risked two thousand dollars’ worth of
property in your possession, and you took every
chance you could with it—”</p>

<p>“Including the risk of my own life,” retorted
Bud. “Look here, Mr. Elder, I wouldn’t get
excited over what T. Glenn Dare thinks. He has
good reason to find fault with me.”</p>

<p>The fair official made a new gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there. Going up
that way was a crazy thing to do, and you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.”</p>

<p>Bud looked at the ground a moment. Then he
said:</p>

<p>“That’s my usual luck, Mr. Elder. I don’t
make any excuses. I see I’m in the wrong, and
I’ll take the short cut out. I haven’t hurt your
airship, and there she is. Mr. T. Glenn Dare is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
here ready to take charge of it. I thank you for
the chance you gave me.”</p>

<p>Bud started away.</p>

<p>“Here, Bud! Come here!”</p>

<p>Bud paused, but he did not return. “I guess
we don’t need you any more, but there ain’t
no call to go ’way mad.”</p>

<p>“You said I ought to be ashamed of myself.
I’m going where I can feel ashamed without attracting
attention.”</p>

<p>Bud smiled, and Mr. Elder looked a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I reckon if your fifty-dollar-a-day man had
gone up there and done what I did, you’d all
be pattin’ him on the back. Like as not there’d
be a piece in the paper about it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder was even more embarrassed.</p>

<p>“When he goes up to-morrow,” went on Bud,
“I reckon you’d better insist that he skim
around over the ground. I tell you what I think,
Mr. Elder,” said Bud, suddenly growing more
serious, “a big bluff goes a long ways. You
wouldn’t dare to criticise your professional
aviator. Why? Because he’s an expert. And
yet there isn’t one of you knows whether he
knows more about aeroplanes than I do. He’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
get the glad hand. I get a good swift kick.
Good bye.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder was at Bud’s side before he could
leave the shed.</p>

<p>“You certainly are a touchy boy,” he said in
a not unkind voice. “I don’t see why I should
apologize to you,” he added, “but I’d like to
do one thing—here’s ten dollars for helping
us out.”</p>

<p>Bud looked up with a peculiar expression.
Never before in his life had he earned so much
money in practically one day. For a moment,
he worked his foot back and forth in the dust.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“That just proves what I said. It’s the bluff
that gets the money and the praise. I told you
I’d do what I could for nothing. I’m satisfied
if you are. But, if I took any pay, why shouldn’t
I have as much as your professional?”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder grew red in the face.</p>

<p>“He is to get fifty dollars a day. What can he
do that I haven’t done? I’m much obliged to
you, Mr. Elder, and I don’t want you to put me
down as a smart aleck. I either work for nothing
or I’m worth as much as the fellow who is no
better.”</p>

<p>The disturbed official became restless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean you want fifty dollars?” he exclaimed,
almost in consternation.</p>

<p>“I should say not,” retorted Bud, “but,” and
he laughed outright, “if you offer me anything,
don’t make it a cent less.”</p>

<p>Before the perplexed official could say anything,
Bud was gone. The crowd was in a thick
ring around the aeroplane, and the boy had no
trouble in making his way almost unobserved
out of the race-track field. With ten cents in
his pocket and tired and sleepy, he hurried toward
the entrance. No one seemed to recognize
in him the “hero of the aeroplane,” the skilled
and daring aviator who had just made a record
breaking flight of 1400 feet in the air.</p>

<p>Money came too hard with Bud to permit him
to spend his ten cents for a ride to town in a
hack. For that reason, although it was not yet
much after four o’clock, he set out on foot to
cover the two-mile walk to his home—or Attorney
Cyrus Stockwell’s house. This was not
a pretentious building, but, being on the edge of
town, it had considerable ground around it, and
the old two-story frame structure had been Bud’s
home for nearly ten years.</p>

<p>Bud’s father had at one time owned a small
foundry in Scottsville; but, his health failing, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
disposed of it, moved to the country, and tried
farming on a small scale. Mrs. Wilson was a
cousin of Mrs. Stockwell’s, and when both Bud’s
parents died the same winter, the boy, at Mrs.
Stockwell’s suggestion, went to live with the
Stockwells. There he had been ever since.</p>

<p>Reaching the house, Bud found it locked tight
as wax. Undoubtedly the lawyer and his wife
had gone to the fair. The key, usually hidden
under the strip of rag carpet on the front porch,
was not there. But this did not interfere much
with Bud. In the rear was a summer kitchen
with an adjoining grape arbor. On this arbor,
Bud had more than once made nocturnal ascents
and descents to and from the kitchen roof, and
thus to the window of his own room.</p>

<p>Shinning up the arbor, he easily entered the
house through the window of his room. It was
dark and close within, but the returned wanderer
was hungry and he hurried at once to the kitchen.
Mrs. Stockwell did not mind Bud “piecing,”
but she was particular about the neatness of her
kitchen. So, instead of leaving traces of his attack
on the larder, Bud used no dishes. He
found milk in the ice box. A dipperful of that
was consumed, and the dipper washed and returned
to its hook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Then with a slice of cold boiled ham, the back,
two wings and the neck of some fried chicken,
six doughnuts, two pieces of bread covered with
new grape jelly, and an apple, Bud went to his
room. Long before his foster parents returned
from the fair, Bud, his hunger satisfied, had undressed,
washed himself and gone to bed.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock, Attorney Stockwell, who
had been reading the local paper on the front
porch, stuck his head into the kitchen and asked
if supper would soon be ready.</p>

<p>“I kind o’ been waitin’ thinkin’ maybe Bud’d
come home this evening,” was Mrs. Stockwell’s
answer.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to count on him, I reckon,”
answered her husband. “He probably won’t
think much about home long as that airship is
on his mind.”</p>

<p>“It’s funny to me,” added Mrs. Stockwell,
stirring the potatoes, “that he wouldn’t take
no pay. Goodness knows he could use it. The
boy ain’t got hardly a whole shirt to his back.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have to be doin’ something soon,”
said the attorney. “I can’t keep him here for
nothin’ all his life. An’ he’s nearly grown
now.”</p>

<p>His wife sighed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s been a purty good boy at that. An’
he’s been quite a help to me. I dunno how I’d
get along without him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you better not wait for him. He’s
gettin’ altogether too smart. If he’s too proud
to take the money he earned, I ain’t. President
Elder gave it to me to hold for him, <em>in trust</em>,
but I guess Bud owes me a good deal more’n
that.”</p>

<p>The Stockwells ate their supper without Bud,
although there was enough talk about him. That
evening the lawyer made inquiries in the boy’s
usual haunts, but no one had seen him since
the aeroplane landed. So the evening passed until
nine o’clock, at which hour Attorney Stockwell
was summoned by telephone to come at
once to Mr. Elder’s private office in the First
National Bank. Here he found a hastily called
conference of fair directors. The president was
there with Judge Pennington and Mr. Waldron,
a country member.</p>

<p>“Here it is in a nutshell,” explained President
Elder. “We either call this fellow’s bluff,
or let him ‘play horse’ with us. What’ll it be?”</p>

<p>The situation was this: Mr. T. Glenn Dare,
the aeroplane expert, gave as a reason for his
failure to appear that he had not expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
reach Scottsville until noon of the previous day.
The work of setting up the airship, he explained,
would have required but a few hours. The reason
for his non-arrival at noon of the day before
was because he had gone to Scottsville, Kentucky,
a small and out-of-the-way place requiring
a drive across country, and having no telephone
or telegraph. Returning to Cincinnati, he had
“wired” the fair officials, after telegraphing
east to his employers for instructions, and had
then hastened to Scottsville, making the last
stage of his journey by trolley car.</p>

<p>This explanation was not satisfactory to Mr.
Elder. Mr. Dare confessed he had not seen any
letters to his firm from the fair officials, and had
started west with only a memorandum of his
destination. He would not concede that his firm
had made a mistake, and boldly asserted that the
mix up was probably due to carelessness on the
part of the fair committee.</p>

<p>“All right,” Mr. Elder had said. “You say
you were in Cincinnati early to-day. Why didn’t
you send us word you’d be here? No telegram
reached any of us.”</p>

<p>“How do I know that?” impudently asked
Mr. Dare. “Looks to me as if you people were
trying to beat me out of a job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“And it looks to me, to speak right out,” replied
Mr. Elder in considerable heat, “as if you
might have been drunk for two or three days.”</p>

<p>Instead of indignantly resenting this suggestion,
Mr. Dare only got red in the face and offered
to produce innumerable affidavits that he
had been wandering around the country since
Monday morning looking for Scottsville and that
he never indulged in intoxicating beverages.</p>

<p>This interview between Mr. Elder and Expert
Dare had taken place on the fair-grounds just
after Bud disappeared and the car had been
housed for the night. It left anything but cordial
relations between the two men. But the
explosion came later. As Mr. Elder was instructing
the watchmen concerning the care of
the airship during the night, Mr. Dare approached.</p>

<p>“In order that we have no further misunderstanding,
I’d like to have a check for one hundred
and fifty dollars—the three days I’ve already
lost.”</p>

<p>The president, put out over his encounter with
Bud, and disgruntled over the conduct of the
expert, whirled like a wild man.</p>

<p>“A check for one hundred and fifty dollars?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t suppose I’m coming all the way
out here for fun, do you?” sneeringly answered
Mr. Dare.</p>

<p>“Just put this in your pipe and smoke it,”
snorted the fair president, shaking his finger in
the expert’s face. “You’ll get paid when you go
to work—that’s the contract. There wasn’t a
thing said about comin’ or goin’. For the three
days left this week, we’ll pay you just fifty
dollars each day. Not a cent more.”</p>

<p>“That aeroplane won’t move a foot till I get
my money. And since this controversy about it,
you’d better pay in advance—three hundred
dollars. No money, no exhibition.”</p>

<p>“We got along without you so far.”</p>

<p>“Violating your contract, yes. Part of the
agreement of sale was that I was to operate the
car. We don’t turn out aeroplanes to every
Tom, Dick and Harry. Under your contract,
that car don’t go up unless I’m in it, and I
don’ go in it till I have my money. There’s
plenty of law to fix that. Do I get my money?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent,” snapped Mr. Elder. “Bud Wilson
will go up in that machine to-morrow.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>BUD MAKES A STRANGE CONTRACT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>President Elder told all this to the assembled
directors. A storm broke at once. Naturally,
Attorney Stockwell approved what the president
had done. He did it for two reasons: he was
anxious to get Bud a profitable job, and he saw
at once that Judge Pennington was opposed to
the action taken by Mr. Elder. In the lively
discussion, the other director, Mr. Waldron,
sided with Mr. Elder because Attorney Stockwell
had once opposed him in a lawsuit.</p>

<p>Judge Pennington argued that Mr. T. Glenn
Dare would undoubtedly sue the association.</p>

<p>“Let him,” exclaimed President Elder. “We
can beat him. He didn’t report, and I’m convinced
he was on a spree somewhere. Look at
the advantage. If we pay him what he demands,
it will be six days at fifty dollars a day. That’s
three hundred dollars. We can save that.”</p>

<p>“This young Wilson won’t work for nothing,
will he?” asked Mr. Waldron.</p>

<p>President Elder felt compelled at this point
to relate his experience with Bud. He told of offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to pay their amateur operator; how the
boy had refused the money, and how Attorney
Stockwell had finally accepted the sum to hold in
trust.</p>

<p>Judge Pennington laughed outright.</p>

<p>“An’ that’s what we’re up against, is it?”
he asked, with a chuckling sneer. “Wouldn’t
take ten dollars an’ wants fifty dollars? And
yet you’re takin’ the risk o’ a lawsuit just to
give him a job.”</p>

<p>“But,” insisted the president, “you forget.
He’ll do in a pinch what he won’t do for wages.
He won’t work for ten dollars a day, but he’ll
work for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Ef he’ll do that,” promptly suggested Director
Waldron, “I vote we give him the job.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t treatin’ the boy right,” chimed
in Attorney Stockwell. “Be fair with him.
He’ll listen to reason. It’s worth more’n ten
dollars to risk your life that way. If you’ll
call it twenty-five dollars I’ll undertake to see
that he does the work.”</p>

<p>“My Lafe would do it for nothin’ as a matter
o’ pride, if he wasn’t sick,” urged Judge Pennington.</p>

<p>“But he is sick,” broke in Mr. Elder. “We’ve
fired our expert, an’ we’ve got to get some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
or cut out the performance. I agree with Director
Stockwell. If we call it twenty-five dollars—and
that’ll only be for three more days—I’m convinced
Bud will help us out.”</p>

<p>But Judge Pennington and Director Waldron
were stubborn. The matter was argued for
nearly an hour, and finally a compromise was
reached. President Elder was authorized to pay
to Bud not over twenty dollars a day to attempt
another ascent. Then the meeting adjourned.
At its conclusion, Attorney Stockwell hurried off
home to find Bud and tell him of his good fortune.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the lawyer had hardly disappeared
when the other three directors met
again on the bank steps.</p>

<p>“That’s all we could do afore Stockwell,”
said Judge Pennington at once. “Ef we’d said
any more, Attorney Stockwell would have put a
bug in the boy’s ear an’ they’d have worked together.
What you want to do, Mr. Elder, is to
get the boy alone. I ain’t no love for him, but
I will say he gave us a good show, and I reckon
he can do it agin. Ef he won’t work for twenty
dollars, give him what’s necessary.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” replied President Elder,
“Stockwell is a good deal on the make. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
thought we’d stand for any more, he’d see that
the boy holds out for the highest figure.”</p>

<p>“Better give him fifty dollars,” slowly conceded
Director Waldron, “ruther than put off
the show. An’ we’ll make money at that. But
it’s ridic’lous for a boy o’ his age.”</p>

<p>“Get him at any figure in reason,” urged
Judge Pennington. “I want the fair to go off
with a boom. An’ if it’s up to the kid to make
it go—all right. But it’ll swell him up awful.”</p>

<p>Before Attorney Stockwell reached his home,
Mrs. Stockwell had discovered Bud’s presence,
although she had not disturbed him. When her
husband reached the house and learned that his
adopted son was safe in bed, he was greatly relieved.
He went at once to Bud’s room. It
was after eleven o’clock. Arousing the sleeping
boy, he prepared to close the deal between Bud
and the fair association.</p>

<p>Bud’s first response was to pull the covers over
his head and snore lustily.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Bud, I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“I have been here all the time,” sleepily responded
the boy. “I ain’t done nothin’. Is it
morning?”</p>

<p>Attorney Stockwell shook him again until the
lad was fully awake. Then he asked him, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
brusquely, what he meant “by riding such
a high horse” with Mr. Elder and refusing to
take the ten dollars.</p>

<p>“Because I said I’d work for nothing,” said
Bud, crawling from under his sheet and sitting
on the bedside.</p>

<p>“But they are willing to pay you, and pay you
well. Men don’t work for nothing. I work all
day for ten dollars,” added the lawyer.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Bud. “I don’t want to
work all my life for ten dollars a day. I want
nothing or what I’m worth.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish,” snorted the lawyer. “You talk
pretty swell for a boy who ain’t never yet made
enough to keep him.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I owe you a good deal of money,”
exclaimed Bud, still blinking his sleepy eyes and
then looking at his foster father sharply.</p>

<p>“We ain’t talkin’ about that,” answered the
lawyer evasively.</p>

<p>“I know ‘<em>we</em>’ ain’t,” said Bud. “But <em>I</em> am.
You never talk about it when I want to. Why
did you take me in? Did my father leave me any
property?”</p>

<p>“The courts’ll take care o’ that at the right
time,” replied Attorney Stockwell pompously.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Bud, sleepily. “When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
they do, you just take out all I’ve cost you and
quit throwin’ it up to me ever’ day.”</p>

<p>The lawyer rose and walked about a moment
in an embarrassed way.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Bud. We won’t quarrel
about that. I ain’t puttin’ you out o’ house an’
home. I didn’t wake you up to talk o’ that. I
got ten dollars here President Elder gave me to
give to you.”</p>

<p>“Keep it yourself,” yawned Bud, “and I
won’t owe you so much.”</p>

<p>“We’ve fired that Mr. Dare,” exclaimed the
lawyer, playing his trump card, “and we held a
meeting to-night to get another operator. We
elected you.”</p>

<p>“Me?” exclaimed Bud, at last fully awake.
“Elected me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on the lawyer. “He got gay
with us—wanted pay for six days, and we discharged
him.”</p>

<p>“And the fair people want me to sail the aeroplane
again?” continued Bud jubilantly.</p>

<p>“That’s what was voted.”</p>

<p>Bud sat up on the edge of the bed, his eyes
snapping and his face wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>“I guess Mr. Elder must have changed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
mind,” Bud commented. “He told me I ‘ought
to be ashamed of myself.’”</p>

<p>“He has. We’re all agreed. And we’ve
agreed, too, that you’re to have twenty-five
dollars a day for your work.”</p>

<p>The boy straightened up as if he had been
struck. From smiles, his face became set, and
finally rebellious. He picked at the bed clothes
a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>“I’m sorry they did that. I’d have done it
for nothing to help out. But when it comes to a
price, I’m worth just as much as Mr. Dare. If
they want to pay me, it’s fifty dollars a day.”</p>

<p>“You won’t do for twenty-five dollars a day
what you’ll do for nothing?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. I said I wouldn’t. That’s all
there is to it.”</p>

<p>“You refuse,” said the lawyer, growing red
in the face.</p>

<p>“You’ve said it.”</p>

<p>Attorney Stockwell fumbled at his collar as
if he were choking. Then he sputtered:</p>

<p>“You can think this over till morning. If you
don’t get some sense into your head by that time,
you’d better find some other place to live.”</p>

<p>“Meaning I’m kicked out,” replied Bud instantly
and springing to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can sleep over it,” added the lawyer.
“Don’t need to act hastily. But it’s no use us
trying to get along together if you’re too proud
to help out when I get you a good job.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to sleep over it,” answered Bud
promptly. “My sleepin’ is done for to-night. If
that’s the verdict, we’ll call it quits.”</p>

<p>The lawyer was palpably embarrassed. He
was afraid to put Bud out for reasons best known
to himself, but he felt like it.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you later,” he snapped suddenly,
and left the room.</p>

<p>Bud’s sleeping wasn’t as nearly finished as
he thought. With youthful agility, he turned in
again, and did not awaken until daylight. The
Stockwells breakfasted early, but Bud’s chores
were done when his foster father appeared.
Somewhat to Bud’s surprise, the affair of the
night before was not recalled, and the boy was
about to escape from the breakfast table when
he was surprised to see President Elder’s well
known rig dash up to the house.</p>

<p>“You won’t listen to me,” explained the lawyer,
in no very good humor, “so Mr. Elder has
come to reason with you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it for fifty dollars or nothing,”
stoutly insisted Bud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mr. Elder appeared on the porch—and
it was apparent that he was not overflowing with
good humor—he wasted very little time. After
greeting the lawyer and his wife, he said:</p>

<p>“Bud, we worked together pretty well yesterday.
Come with me. I want to see you.”</p>

<p>“Go along,” exclaimed Attorney Stockwell,
in a tone of authority. But this was not needed.
Bud needed no urging. With a smile, he led the
way to the buggy.</p>

<p>The fair official started toward the center of
the town. Before he could open negotiations,
Bud exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Mr. Elder, I reckon I know what you want.
You’ve fallen out with the guy that threw us
down and you want me to do the aeroplane stunt
again.”</p>

<p>President Elder smiled.</p>

<p>“You know what I said yesterday,” went on
Bud. “I don’t like to break my word. But don’t
you think you people are makin’ me purty
cheap?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not as cheap as you think!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Stockwell told me I’m to get twenty-five
dollars.”</p>

<p>“And you think that ain’t enough?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fifty dollars,” said Bud with a smile, “or
nothing.”</p>

<p>The thrifty official grasped at this straw.</p>

<p>“Are you willing to do it for nothing?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I’ll do it as a favor, and I want a
favor in return.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Mr. Elder suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well,” went on Bud, with some embarrassment,
“you’re a big man in this town, Mr.
Elder. You can get about anything you want.
I reckon Judge Pennington would do you a favor
if you asked.”</p>

<p>“Are you in trouble with Judge Pennington?”</p>

<p>“I’m not. But two of my friends are. See
that, Mr. Elder,” continued Bud, showing the
ring Madame Zecatacas had given him. His
companion gazed at it intently.</p>

<p>“That’s a charm,” explained Bud. “It was
given to me by an old gypsy who hadn’t any
other way to show me she was my friend. It’s
a good luck piece. I don’t know as it helped me
any, but the old woman who gave it to me wanted
it to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” began Mr. Elder.</p>

<p>“This old woman and her son-in-law made
Lafe Pennington mad. It wasn’t their fault. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was his. Yesterday, Judge Pennington had ’em
arrested for assaultin’ Lafe, which they hadn’t.
They yanked ’em off’n the fair-grounds and
locked ’em up. They’re goin’ to have a trial
to-day. They ain’t done nothin’, but they are my
friends, in a kind of a way. If you’ll persuade
Judge Pennington to let ’em go, I’ll work the
airship all week for nothin’.”</p>

<p>President Elder laughed. Then he slapped
the boy on the back.</p>

<p>“Bud,” he said laughing heartily, “you are
certainly a strange boy. That’s a go. I’ll
promise.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em out right away,” continued Bud, “so
they can get in a full day tellin’ fortunes.”</p>

<p>“Right away,” laughed the fair president.</p>

<p>“Then I guess I’ll take the first hack out to
the grounds and get busy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you won’t mind my paying your
expenses,” suggested the president, when they
reached the square.</p>

<p>“Got to have hack fare and dinner money,”
said Bud, with a smile. And accepting a five
dollar bill, Bud was off to the fair-grounds and
airship shed again.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE FLIGHT IN THE DARK.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At twelve o’clock that day, while Bud was
busy on the aeroplane, Mr. T. Glenn Dare and
Attorney Cyrus Stockwell suddenly appeared
before the airship shed. Mr. Dare walked in
briskly, took off his coat, and gave every sign of
taking charge of the apparatus. Bud shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Strangers not allowed in here, sir.”</p>

<p>The expert laughed.</p>

<p>“Since I’ve a contract that calls for my being
here, I was about to say the same thing to you,
young man.”</p>

<p>“I guess we understand ourselves,” replied
Bud, with composure. “President Elder has
been in here several times this morning. He left
orders for me to keep all strangers out.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re goin’ to put me out,” smiled
Mr. Dare.</p>

<p>“I would if I had time,” answered Bud. “But
I’m busy. Any way, that ain’t the program.
I’m just to tell you to get out.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dare laughed outright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Put me out,” he said banteringly.</p>

<p>“Jim,” called out Bud, good naturedly, and
resuming his work on the engine, “accommodate
the gentleman. He wants to be put out.”</p>

<p>Jim Hoarr, the night watchman, who was
curled up in a corner of the shed, slowly arose
and hitched up his trousers. Jim was not tall,
but his tight undershirt exposed such a mass of
rounded muscle and chest that Mr. Dare at once
stepped back.</p>

<p>“Wot gent?” asked Jim sleepily, glancing
first at Mr. Dare and then at Attorney Stockwell.</p>

<p>“Bud,” exclaimed Attorney Stockwell angrily,
“come here.”</p>

<p>“I’m busy,” said Bud, polishing the engine
industriously.</p>

<p>The lawyer stepped over to Bud and caught
him by the shoulder. The next moment, Attorney
Stockwell was sliding over the worn and
dusty grass outside the shed and Jim was hurrying
back for another victim. But his services
were not needed. Mr. T. Glenn Dare had caught
up his coat and escaped beneath the canvas on
the far side of the tent.</p>

<p>With difficulty Bud refrained from laughing.
But he ran out after his foster father.</p>

<p>“I want to apologize for that,” he began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
“Jim didn’t understand.”</p>

<p>Attorney Stockwell was boiling with rage.</p>

<p>“I thought you told me you wouldn’t do this
again,” he almost shouted, “for less than fifty
dollars a day.”</p>

<p>“Or nothing,” added Bud.</p>

<p>The lawyer’s face grew white.</p>

<p>“You ungrateful whelp,” he almost hissed.
“Don’t you set your foot in my house again.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Bud indifferently, turning
away.</p>

<p>Attorney Stockwell was too full of rage to talk.
As Mr. Dare joined him, they turned and hastened
away.</p>

<p>“That’s all we wanted,” said the lawyer at
last when he found his tongue. “Now you’ve
got to come back when it’s time to make the
flight and offer to take charge. Have a witness
with you, and if they refuse to accept your
services, you have a plain case. I’ll arrange
with Judge Clark to issue a writ this afternoon.
As for this watchman, we’ll have him locked up
before night and discharged to boot.”</p>

<p>“How about the kid?” asked the expert.</p>

<p>Attorney Stockwell shook his head ominously.</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to him all right. Never fear as
to that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Which meant that he was already sorry that
he had ordered Bud away from his house.</p>

<p>Attorney Stockwell represented a type of lawyers
found in all small towns. Without reputation
for pronounced legal ability, he undertook
all cases that came his way and what he had told
Bud was true; often enough he gave his services
for ten dollars a day when he could get no more.
Therefore, when T. Glenn Dare had called on
him that morning and offered him fifty dollars
to protect his interests in the aeroplane dispute,
the lawyer forgot local pride—even overlooked
the fact that he might be called on to take action
against his fellow fair directors.</p>

<p>If he had any compunctions on this score, they
disappeared when he learned that President
Elder had induced his foster son to accept service
once more without recompense.</p>

<p>“Your redress is very clear,” Attorney Stockwell
told Mr. Dare when the latter explained all
the facts in the case. “The contract of sale calls
for one thousand eight hundred dollars for the
aeroplane, but it also stipulates that you are to
be employed for six days at fifty dollars a day.
The cost of the machine, is, therefore, two thousand
one hundred dollars. So far, I understand,
nothing has been paid on the machine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a cent,” explained the representative of
the manufacturers. “The First National Bank
guaranteed the payment on the aeroplane proving
satisfactory. I’ve had no chance to demonstrate
this.”</p>

<p>“That’s all that is necessary,” sagely commented
the lawyer. “If the directors do not give
you that chance this afternoon, we will go before
the county court, secure a writ of replevin, turn
it over to the sheriff, and to-night, a deputy
sheriff will levy on the machine. If the directors
do not then comply with their contract, you will
have a right to remove the aeroplane.”</p>

<p>At two-thirty in the afternoon, Mr. Dare reappeared
at the fair-grounds, but he kept aloof
from the airship shed until he saw President
Elder appear. To the latter, he formally made
application to be permitted to make the flight.</p>

<p>“You’re four days too late, young man. You
didn’t keep your contract, and we won’t keep
ours.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse?” asked Mr. Dare, turning
to the ’bus driver, Doug’ Jackson, who was with
the aviator and on a pass which he had at last
secured.</p>

<p>“Is Doug’ your witness?” asked Mr. Elder,
smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Doug’ threw out his chest.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stockwell told me to come along,” he
explained. “He give me a pass.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was in progress, Jim
Hoarr, the muscular night watchman, had caught
sight of Mr. Dare. Still eager to be of service,
he had approached the group. Seeing him,
President Elder laughed.</p>

<p>“Jim,” he said, “Doug’ has a pass that’ll take
him out o’ the grounds, but I think Mr. Dare
might like help.”</p>

<p>Before even Jim could get busy, the alarmed
aviator had disappeared in the fast gathering
crowd.</p>

<p>A little after three o’clock, Bud made his
second flight. The news of the previous day’s
exploit had spread not only through the town
but even into the near-by country, and the crowd
was immense. The flight was not as spectacular
as that of the day before, but it was longer and
not less successful. Four times the perfectly
working car circled the half-mile track. The
time, taken with great ceremony by the trotting
and running horse judges assembled in their
stand, was officially announced as four minutes.
This, considering the turns, was remarkably fast.
Bud offered at the end of the flight to make another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
short flight with a passenger but this was
vetoed.</p>

<p>Hardly had Bud alighted when two eager
figures pushed their way forward. They were
Madame Zecatacas and her son-in-law.</p>

<p>“Look here, Kid,” began the latter at once and
extending an awkward hand, “me an’ the ole
lady has come to tell you we’re much obliged to
you.”</p>

<p>“For what?” asked Bud, pretending ignorance.</p>

<p>“Never you mind about that,” continued the
man gruffly.</p>

<p>“We’re on all right. They didn’t make no
bones about it. You squared it all right. How
’bout it, ole lady?”</p>

<p>The Gypsy Queen reached out her brown
hands, took Bud’s hand in one of hers and
tapped the ring, which he still wore, with the
other.</p>

<p>“The Gypsy Queen sees good fortune for the
young gentleman. Wear old Zecatacas’ ring—it
will bring good luck. She can give no more.”</p>

<p>Bud was sure he saw tears in the old woman’s
eyes; but, pressing his hand in hers, she said no
more.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Kid,” went on the man, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
means a lot. I’d rather have it than money.
We ain’t got nothin’—we’re poor people, but
when Jack Stanley kin do ye a turn it’ll be done.
That’s all.”</p>

<p>How well Jack Stanley and Madame Zecatacas
kept their word, Bud soon found out.</p>

<p>The aeroplane trial at an end, every one
seemed to forget Bud. Homeless at last, he did
not care much. So long as his engagement with
the fair officials lasted, he determined to stay in
the aeroplane shed, which he now began to call
the “aerodrome.” His only regret was that he
had had no opportunity to say good-bye to Mrs.
Stockwell. But he would send her a letter. Meanwhile,
with Mr. Elder’s five dollars in his pocket
to provide for his meals, he whistled at hard luck
and counted himself content.</p>

<p>Yet, as evening came on, the thought of Mrs.
Stockwell bothered him. So long as he belonged
in her home, a failure to return at night did not
bother him a great deal. Now that he was not
going back again, he had a longing to tell her
“good-bye.” Besides there were a few clothes,
his parents’ pictures, some airship drawings and
a couple of books that he felt he would like to
have before Attorney Stockwell might take a
notion to destroy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>One of these books Bud was determined not to
lose. This was a new story—“In the Clouds for
Uncle Sam or Morey Marshall of the Signal
Corps.” Anything relating to aeroplanes interested
Bud, and this book was wholly about the
new flying machines, but, in Morey Marshall’s
adventures, he had just reached the most exciting
part.</p>

<p>“Whatever happens,” said Bud to himself,
“I’ve got to find out what came of the blue
packet Morey found in his father’s old desk and
what happened to Morey and Amos when they
ran away from home.”</p>

<p>But it was some days before Bud had a chance
to renew his reading of this tale.</p>

<p>In the early evening, he knew that the lawyer
always spent a few hours “up town.”</p>

<p>Allowing a reasonable time after the usual
supper hour, Bud stealthily approached the
Stockwell residence from the rear, and entered
the yard through the garden gate. There was a
light in the kitchen, but Mrs. Stockwell was not
there. Tiptoeing around the house, he heard
voices on the porch. One was that of a stranger.
But he easily made out that of the lawyer, too,
and he stepped back. Mrs. Stockwell was not in
sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll at least get my things,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>Making his way to the grape arbor, he shinned
up to the summer kitchen roof, and, in bare feet,
entered his room. Without venturing to strike a
light, he felt around, got the articles he had come
for, and then, stooping in a corner, by the light of
a few matches, he wrote a note on the fly leaf of
one of his few books.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>Dear Mother Stockwell,” it ran, “your husban’
has drove me away, and I got to go, but I’ll
be back to see you some time you have been good
to me and I’ll be good to you when I can so no
more at presence from</i></p>

<p class="right">“<i>Bud.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Opening the book on the table, he softly escaped
over the roof. He was about to drop onto
the grape arbor, when voices sounded immediately
beneath him.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t wait for me, Mother,” said one
of them—easily distinguished as that of the
lawyer himself. “I’ll be out late on business.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t about Bud, is it?” asked the other—Mrs.
Stockwell.</p>

<p>“No,” sharply replied her husband. “But he
caused it. It’s legal business. You can’t understand
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder why the child don’t come home?”
said Mrs. Stockwell.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be home all right. I’m going to
send for him. I knew you would worry about
him again, so I told ’em to tell him you wanted
to see him.”</p>

<p>“Cyrus,” added his wife, “I don’t think you’re
treatin’ Bud right. He’s a good boy if he
has half a chance.”</p>

<p>“Well,” retorted the lawyer, “you can treat
him well to-night by keepin’ him in after he gets
here. I’m goin’ out to the fair-ground to-night
with a deputy sheriff and levy on the aeroplane
that’s turned his head. We got a writ of replevin
this afternoon and a deputy sheriff is
goin’ to take the machine for Mr. Dare, who’s
out on the front porch. If Bud gets in the way
or interferes, he’ll be locked up for his pains.”</p>

<p>“Lands sakes, Cyrus, Bud ain’t done no
crime, has he?”</p>

<p>“No, but he’s made a fool of himself. And
he’s tryin’ to make one o’ me. I’m goin’ up
town now for a while, and I reckon I’ll be home
’bout midnight. You keep Bud here when he
comes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lock him in his room,” exclaimed Mrs.
Stockwell nervously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>As the two passed into the kitchen, Bud
slipped down onto the arbor, recovered his shoes,
glanced into the empty kitchen, reached into the
window and captured a generous slice of jelly
cake from a near-by table, and was off down the
garden path.</p>

<p>By half past eight, he was again on the fair-grounds.
He had had a half hour’s walk in
which to think over the thing he had heard. Out
of all the projects that flashed into his busy
brain, one only remained. It was a daring idea,
but the more he thought it over, the more determined
he was to execute it. Before going to the
“aerodrome,” he went to the tent of the Gypsy
Queen. When he left it, Jack Stanley was with
him.</p>

<p>Bud and Madame Zecatacas’ son-in-law made
a quick tour among some of Stanley’s friends,
all of whom, after a brief talk, seemed highly
amused. And when Bud at last made his way
across the dark enclosure within the race-track,
Jack and four of his husky friends were gathered
in a knot in the shadow of the judges’ stand.</p>

<p>Approaching the aeroplane shed, Bud broke
into a run and arrived, apparently, out of breath.</p>

<p>“Jim,” he panted, “there’s trouble. Go right
over to the ticket office and get Mr. Elder on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
telephone. When you get him read him this message.
Got to get busy.”</p>

<p>Finding a piece of paper, Bud laboriously
wrote a few lines. Then, taking the vigilant
watchman out into the dark where he could not
see the message until he reached the office nearly
a half mile away, Bud folded the scrap of paper,
shoved it into the waiting watchman’s hand and
pushed him forward.</p>

<p>“You’ll watch things while I’m gone?”
called the hurrying messenger over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“You bet I will, Jim. I’ll not leave her. You
can trust me.”</p>

<p>As the flying watchman passed the judges’
stand, Jack Stanley and his pals slipped around
the little structure to keep out of his sight, and
then the highly amused group rushed toward the
airship shed.</p>

<p>The perspiring Jim had some trouble in getting
President Elder on the wire, but when he
did so, he read the fair official this note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi">“<i>Mr. Eldur</i></p>

<p>“<i>They have got up a skeme to take the air
plane, and I can beet em by takin it away where
they aint no one knows where it is. Dont worry
about us, for I ll be on hand promp tomorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
at reglar time for the show. Dont have no fear
of nuthin for I m all O. K.</i></p>

<p class="right">“<i>Bud Wilson.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>When, in response to President Elder’s forceful
injunction, Jim, the watchman, reached the
airship shed again, the canvas front was up, the
shed was empty, and only a smell of gasoline
told of the stolen aeroplane.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>DUMPED INTO THE MARSH.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Plunging through the dark in an aeroplane,
two hundred feet or more above the earth and in
a moonless night, was Bud’s predicament. Up
to that time, at least, neither the Wright Brothers,
Mr. Farman, Mr. Latham, nor Mr. Curtiss
had had such an experience. When the chill
night breeze struck the boy’s face and he found
himself sailing into what was like a black cave,
for a moment he was panic stricken.</p>

<p>Of course, he had not taken such a hazardous
chance without a plan. In a vague way, he had
outlined what he hoped to do. But it was easier
to lay that plan out in his mind while on the firm
ground than it was to put it into execution high
up in the impenetrable and chill air.</p>

<p>The thing that almost rattled Bud was the fact
that he could not see the ground. He could not
even make out the lines of the fences beneath
him. It was like smoking a cigar in the dark
when you can only tell that it is going by the
fire on the end. The lack of vibration in an aeroplane
is most pronounced in the dark. Like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
soaring bird, the ship glides forward with hardly
a whirr or rattle to mark its flight. But the
breeze on Bud’s face and the spinning propellers
told him he was advancing, and with the speed
of a train.</p>

<p>“I got to strike the Little Town pike first
thing,” said Bud to himself at last, as he began
to get his wits together. “If I can’t do that,
I’m up a stump. That’s my only guide to where
I got to go.”</p>

<p>The scattered lights of the edge of Scottsville
were just rushing beneath the aeroplane.</p>

<p>“I’ll follow the edge of town to the north,”
went on Bud, talking almost aloud to himself.
“When I come to the river and the bridge, I’ll
head north and get down low enough to see the
road. That’ll be my guide.”</p>

<p>Five miles to the north of Scottsville, lay
Little Town—three saloons, a postoffice, a store
and an elevator. Northwest from Little Town,
a road reached into the “hills.” In any other
part of the country these hills would have been
hardly noticeable. But in Scott County, Indiana,
they were comparatively mountains. Bud knew
them as the scenes of many picnics and excursions.</p>

<p>At Camp’s Mill, about three miles from Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Town on the “hill road,” where a creek, a mill
race and a head-gate afforded small water-power
for a flour and saw mill, a dirt road turned
sharply off to the north. Within a mile and in
a thickly wooded region, the “hills” suddenly
opened to enclose a pond. Little Town people
called it Camp’s Lake. Visitors from larger
places usually described it as a “frog pond.”</p>

<p>In the spring and summer, the shores of this
little body of water—scarce a quarter of a mile
long—were swamps full of cattails and spearmint.
As Bud figured it, the damp, flat vegetation
would now be dead and dry. To this secluded
and seldom visited point, the youngster
had decided to attempt to carry the stolen aeroplane.
This was not wholly because the place
was far from Scottsville. Bud had figured on all
the problems he would have to face. That of
making an ascent the next day bothered him a
good deal more than the concealment of the airship.
Here, he thought, he might be able to put
into execution the only device he could figure
out for starting the car on its flight again.</p>

<p>A sudden rumble beneath the car struck on
Bud’s ears.</p>

<p>“That’s the bridge,” he said to himself. “It’s
a team crossing the bridge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not mistake that sound; nor would
any other Scottsville boy. Bridges may look a
good deal alike, but no two of them sound alike.
The hollow noise of a wagon on a bridge always
strikes the same note. That note Bud had
known for ten years. And, though the structure
was out of sight, the boy brought the aeroplane
as sharply about as if it had been day. It was
now a straightaway course of five miles to Little
Town due north.</p>

<p>When the town lights were a half mile or so
behind him, the determined lad inclined his horizontal
rudders until the ship sank close enough
to the ground to reveal forms. A little lower,
the dusty, white turnpike unwound beneath him,
and then he steadied the craft. Not until then
did he begin to feel somewhat composed.</p>

<p>So far, the only thing that had bothered him
was the fear that he might not be able to get
away with the aeroplane successfully. Now he
had time to think of something just as important.</p>

<p>“I wonder what they’ll think?” Bud finally
asked himself. Then he recalled how President
Elder had reprimanded him for taking chances
with the car.</p>

<p>“Whew,” whistled the lad, as the thought
came back to him, “like as not, he’ll be sore all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
over now. And what if I do land her all right
and get her going again to-morrow? I can’t
come down at the fair-ground or the sheriff’ll
nab me. I might as well have stayed. If I go
back and give the show and sail away again
without landin’—and that’s the only thing to
do—where’ll I go? They can watch me and
follow me. I can get more gasoline somewhere,
but I can’t hide out another night with the sheriff
and Mr. Stockwell and Mr. Dare on my
track.”</p>

<p>With this new trouble bothering him, he held
his course toward Little Town. Once, like a
great, black, groaning bird, he shot over a buggy.
The horse shied, and there were several alarmed
imprecations from the occupants.</p>

<p>“Lucky they didn’t shoot,” thought Bud.
“But I can’t fly higher and know where I am.”</p>

<p>Bud’s selection of Camp’s Lake as a desirable
spot for his purpose showed how familiar he was
with the country in all directions about Scottsville.
His familiarity with this particular place
was due to the fact that his father’s farm had
been just south of Little Town. Camp’s Mill and
its old-fashioned water wheel had always been
Bud’s joy. And Josh Camp was still one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
boy chums. Or he would have been had Bud remained
near Little Town.</p>

<p>He and Josh had, in earlier years, a firm belief
that fish existed in Camp’s Lake. They had
never been able to absolutely prove this, but
many a night’s work with a lantern had proven
that, if the pond were devoid of fish, it was infested
with bull frogs of giant girth. The final
argument in bringing the flying boy to his old
stamping grounds was this.</p>

<p>Camp’s Lake, whether lake or pond, was never
devoid of water. Even beyond its margins, the
swampy cattail beds oozed moisture. At the
head of the body of water was a spring which
flowed ceaselessly. At the foot of the lake, at one
time, the surplus water drained away through
the lower marsh ground to the creek feeding the
mill-pond, a mile away at Camp’s Mill.</p>

<p>As the country cleared up and the supply of
water in the creek became less certain, Josh’s
father—who owned the land about Camp Lake—determined
to utilize the supply going to waste
there. Accounts of water storage in western irrigation
districts had inspired this. The last
time Bud saw the place, he found that Mr. Camp
had dammed up the spillway at the end of the
lake. In the center of the dam, he had built a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
head-gate; and, from this, leading over the
marsh, he had constructed a flume about four
feet wide leading to the creek below.</p>

<p>“The place behind the hills is a good place to
hide,” thought Bud, reviewing the situation,
“the flat shores of the pond are the best place
to land without breaking anything, and the old
flume is the best starting apparatus I can think
of.”</p>

<p>He knew there was an old flat-bottom boat and
a skiff on Camp’s Lake. On these, with Josh’s
help, if he could get it, and any other assistance
that he could procure, he meant to carry the aeroplane
to the dam. It was a part of his plan to
place the flat boat in the flume. Balancing the
aeroplane on this, he was counting on Mr. Camp’s
permission to throw open the head-gate, suddenly
flood the flume with the pent up water,
and, as the boat rushed forward, to gain an impetus
that would start him on a new flight.</p>

<p>Bud’s first sight of Little Town was the green
railroad switch light at the settlement limits.
He headed toward it, and, cutting out the village,
passed diagonally over the adjacent fields in
search of the road leading to the mill. At first,
he missed it. The strain had made him nervous.
Although he had not been in the air over fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
minutes, he felt as if he had been up an hour. He
had thoughtlessly started in his shirt sleeves,
and was chilled.</p>

<p>Everything seemed so desolate and quiet that
there was an almost compelling temptation to
make a descent and trust to luck. But the boy
dismissed the idea, gritted his teeth, and, clutching
the levers with his benumbed fingers, made
another attempt to find the dark, winding country
road.</p>

<p>“What am I goin’ to do when I got to strike
off over the woods from the mill?” thought Bud.
“This ought to be pie compared to that.”</p>

<p>Dropping lower and lower, the nervous young
aviator finally brushed something light that rattled.
He was over a field of corn in the shock.
As he gasped and threw the car upward, again
he heard the unmistakable “thud,” “thud” of
a horse’s hoofs. Judging that they were on the
unseen road, he continued his upward flight until
he was out of possible sight, and then altered his
course to bring him over the newly located road.</p>

<p>In a few moments, the sound of the horse and
vehicle were far behind. Then he dropped down
again until two dark lines marked the shrubbery
lined lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now for the old mill,” murmured Bud,
greatly relieved.</p>

<p>It does not take long to cover three miles in an
aeroplane. Almost before he could believe it,
the sharp turn in the road, the wide clearing, the
dark pile that he knew was the mill, and then
the almost phosphorescent sheen of the dark mill-pond
marked the end of the second stage of Bud’s
wild flight.</p>

<p>“If there’s anything in the old gypsy’s ring,
I can use it now,” muttered Bud. “It’s all
blind from this on, but I reckon I know the way.
Here goes, any way.”</p>

<p>With a bound upward, Bud headed the aeroplane
over the trees beyond the mill-pond. Three
hundred feet over the forest, he steadied the airship.
But only for a moment. All was dark beneath,
and yet Bud knew that the open marsh
and lake were just ahead. From that point, he
might as well have closed his eyes. It was all
luck and instinct now.</p>

<p>Catching his breath, the boy lowered his horizontal
rudders. With his eyes glued on the
seemingly endless black beneath him, he leaned
further and further forward. Twice he started
upright, twice he hesitated, and then, with feverish
speed, his hand shot out and shut off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
engine. The propellers died away, but the car
plunged ahead with its speed apparently unchecked.</p>

<p>Lower and lower sank the drifting aeroplane.
Again Bud leaned nervously forward to catch
some sign of the margin of the water. What
had happened? He had surely gone a mile! In
the still night air came a sudden splash. With
it, rose the guttural honk of a bull frog. The
sound was dead ahead and almost beneath him.</p>

<p>With renewed energy, he swung his vertical
rudder lever and the car drifted quickly to the
right. Under the impulse of the turn, it darted
downward. There was a rasping brush against
the tall, dry swamp vegetation and the aeroplane,
touching first with its starboard end on the soft
marsh bed, settled with a dragging jolt on the
weeds and grasses.</p>

<p>There was a breaking creak, as the end of the
framework struck, but when Bud knew the flight
was at an end he sank back into his seat with a
gulp of relief.</p>

<p>“I’m here,” he sighed, “right among the
snakes and frogs. Maybe the machine’s busted,
and maybe not. Anyway, I’ve got a fine long
job of waitin’ for day.”</p>

<p>He was breathing as if he had just finished a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
race. When he had got around to normal again,
he made an attempt to get his bearings. With
his hands on the framework, he crawled from
the car. His feet sank into the soft ground and
water oozed into his deep foot prints. Then he
listened. He fancied he heard the soft lap of
water just ahead. That meant the lake. But it
was useless to try to reach it. The margin led
nowhere and it would be softer than where he
was.</p>

<p>A good deal of the romance of his adventure
disappeared at once. It was exciting enough to
navigate an aeroplane through the pathless
black sky; but it was far from interesting or comfortable
to sit up all night with the chill air benumbing
his coatless body and keep sleepless
company with bugs, frogs and snakes in a damp
marsh.</p>

<p>“And I ain’t goin’ to,” exclaimed Bud. “The
marsh gets softer toward the lake, but it gets
firmer toward the hill.”</p>

<p>He debated and hesitated for an hour, growing
colder and more miserable all the time, and then,
in desperation, he got stiffly out of the chair on
which he had been cramped and plunged through
the bog toward the high ground.</p>

<p>The mucky swamp was bad enough and, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
than once, Bud thought himself hopelessly
mired. But in the end, exhausted, his face and
hands scratched with the weeds he had fallen
against and his trousers and shoes a coat of
clayey black mud, he fell over a boulder and
tumbled out onto dry land.</p>

<p>What turned out to be as great a strain was
the effort to make his way through the woods to
Camp’s Mill. Bud was no coward, but there is
something about a journey at midnight through
an owly, twig-snapping wood that is apt to give
any one the creeps. When the double darkness
of the thick trees finally gave way to a more open
gloom, and Bud knew the Camp home was somewhere
just ahead, he broke into a dead run, a
cold perspiration thick all over his body.</p>

<p>And, as he at last found the gate of Josh’s
home and a deep-barking dog lunged at him, he
was about ready to pronounce Madame Zecatacas’
ring a failure. But his troubles for the night
were over. Josh’s father, responding to the
watchdog’s bark, demanded to know what was
wanted. In a few moments, Bud was taken in.
It was hard to explain the situation, but Bud’s condition
was almost explanation enough. In an
hour, refreshed with milk, bread and butter and
cold ham, the airship thief was put to sleep in
the spare room.</p>

<small>THE ROMNEY RING BRINGS NEWS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hello, Josh. What time is it?” called Bud,
sticking his head out of the window of the spare
room. The sun was high in the sky, and Bud,
just awake, had caught sight of his friend crossing
the dooryard with a milk pail in his hand.</p>

<p>“Time the milkin’ was over,” answered Josh.
“But I ain’t had hardly no time yet. I been over
to see her, Bud. She’s a jim dandy.”</p>

<p>Bud, in Josh’s rough but freshly ironed night
shirt, leaned further out of the window. His
eyes were yet blinking, but the mention of “her”
brought him to his full senses at once. He had
slept late, worn with the exertion and strain of
the night before, and Mr. Camp had not awakened
him. The near-by mill was already groaning
with its daily grist, and breakfast was undoubtedly
over.</p>

<p>“She ain’t broke anywhere is she?” asked
Bud eagerly.</p>

<p>“How’d I know? I been down there to the
lake, but you don’t reckon I been over where she
is? But she looks fine as silk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve got to help me to-day, Josh,” went
on Bud, beginning to skin off his chum’s long
night gown.</p>

<p>Josh had come up to the window and was peering
into the sacred precincts of the spare room.</p>

<p>“That’s what I calklated,” he said, setting
down his steaming milk pail. “An’ that’s why
I didn’t dig over in the mud when I was down
to see her. We got trompin’ enough ’thout lookin’
for more.”</p>

<p>The bedroom was cool and grateful; the high
feather bed, with its blue and white tasseled
counterpane looked more than tempting, but
Bud had only two thoughts now—he smelled frying
ham, and he was anxious to see whether his
airship was injured.</p>

<p>“Where’s my clothes?” he exclaimed, looking
for them in vain.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I forgot,” explained Josh. “They’re
dryin’. You can’t wear them pants afore
noon. I dunno as yo’ kin wear ’em then.”</p>

<p>“But my shoes?”</p>

<p>“Them’s as bad. We got oats in ’em dryin’
’em out. Mother washed your pants first thing
this mornin’.”</p>

<p>Bud laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s mighty good o’ you folks. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
can’t stay here. I got a lot to do. I mean <em>we</em>
have.”</p>

<p>“We figured that all out,” laughed Josh.
“Your things’ll be dry by noon. This mornin’
yo’ kin have my plow shoes an’ ole mill pants.”</p>

<p>When Bud emerged from the dustless and
spotless bedroom to go to the basin bench out
near the well, he was attired as if for a masquerade.
Josh’s pants were so long that they had
to be rolled up, and his old shoes were much too
large. After a good wash up and an elaborate
combing of his hair, he responded to Mrs.
Camp’s smiling call to breakfast.</p>

<p>“It certainly is good fur sore eyes,” commented
Josh’s mother as Bud sat down to breakfast—all
alone—“to see Bud Wilson agin. I
ain’t seen hide n’r hair o’ you in ten year, I
reckon. An’ how air ye?”</p>

<p>Bud, between mouthfuls of fried ham, biscuits
and pancakes, told of his life since he went to
live with Attorney Stockwell. It took some time.</p>

<p>“An’ who’s on your pa’s farm?” asked Mrs.
Camp.</p>

<p>Bud shook his head.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s been sold,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Must a brought a good price,” suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Mrs. Camp. “It was a good piece o groun’, as
I recollec’.”</p>

<p>Bud shook his head again.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said, his mouth full of
cakes and maple syrup, “like as not. Only I didn’t
see none o’ the money ef it was.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Camp eyed him closely. Then she shook
her head in turn.</p>

<p>“I reckon ye ain’t old enough yet to be told.
But somepins comin’ to you, Bud. Don’t ye fergit
that. It was a good piece o’ land and it’d
bring a good price.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll work out all right,” laughed Bud,
with boyish indifference—but drinking in every
one of Mrs. Camp’s words just the same. “This
charm is goin’ to bring me good luck.”</p>

<p>Then he explained the part that Madame Zecatacas,
the Gypsy Queen, had played in his
recent experiences, and exhibited his ring. At
that moment, Josh’s father, Mr. Camp—“Stump”
Camp—as he was generally known,
entered the kitchen from the mill. He was a
small man, with large and bushy tobacco-stained
whiskers and considerable curiosity. Bud repeated
the story of the ring.</p>

<p>“Jack <em>Stanley</em>,” exclaimed Mr. Camp with a
hearty guffaw. “Why, I’m sprized, Bud, ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
don’t know him. He ain’t no gypsy, an’ he ain’t
no Stanley, ’though all them horse traders give
out they’re gypsies, an’ most o’ ’em say they’re
Stanleys. You know him, Mother,” he said,
turning to his wife. “He’s ole Bill Reed’s boy
’at run off with Red Stanley’s gang. I knowed
’em all. Red Stanley’s wife set up fur a great
fortune teller, an’ she had a sign sayin’ she was
Madame Somepin or Ruther.”</p>

<p>“Madame Zecatacas?” interrupted Bud.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Mr. Camp. “I seen her
three years ago to the fair. I knowed ’em all.
They traded through this country a good many
years. They used to camp over nigh Little
Town. That’s where John Reed, old Bill Reed’s
boy, fell in with Stanley’s girl, an’ followed the
gang away.”</p>

<p>“Shore,” commented Mrs. Camp, “I recollec’.
And want it ole man Reed ’at sold that sixty
acres to Bud’s pa?”</p>

<p>Mr. Camp knit his brows a moment, expectorated
slowly into the wood box, and then nodded
his head.</p>

<p>“How ’bout that, Bud?” he exclaimed suddenly.
“How did that trouble ’bout your pa’s
farm ever come out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was any trouble about
it,” answered Bud. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Mr. Camp looked surprised. Then he slapped
his knee.</p>

<p>“Bud,” he almost chuckled, “you hang onto
that ring and hang on to John Reed, or ‘Jack
Stanley’ as he calls hisself. Ef I ain’t mistook,
he kin do ye some good.”</p>

<p>Bud was alert.</p>

<p>“I feel it in my bones he is goin’ to help me
somehow. What is it?”</p>

<p>“I kin see that lawyer as took ye in never told
you. But everybody up this way knows the
facks. I ain’t desirin’ to make no trouble fur
nobody, and may be ’tain’t my say, but facks is
facks.”</p>

<p>“You mean ’bout the deed?” interrupted the
rotund Mrs. Camp, who was one of those country
women who know what is going on around them.</p>

<p>Mr. Camp nodded his head. Then he scratched
his chin through his luxuriant whiskers and remarked,
in a slow, judicial tone:</p>

<p>“Bud, when your pa bought that sixty acres
o’ ole man Reed, he give eighty dollars a acre
fur it. Bein’ a easy-goin’ man not used to that
sort o’ business, he took the deed and stuck it
away when he ought a’ took it to the courthouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
an’ recorded it. One day when your ma’s cousin,
Lawyer Stockwell, was visitin’ him and he was
complainin’, they took out the papers an’, lo an’
behold, they discivered that Mrs. Reed, ole Bill’s
wife, hadn’t jined in the transfer.”</p>

<p>“The lawyer took the paper, as your pa told
me more’n onct, fur I knowed him well, an’ set
out to get Mrs. Reed’s name to the dockyment.
That’d been easy enough like as not on’y it was
jest about the time Mrs. Reed and Bill fell out
and sepyrated. She’d gone to Indinoplis and
afore the lawyer could ketch her, she was off to
Calyfornee. Mr. Stockwell went clean out there
to find her onct, but he never did.”</p>

<p>Bud remembered the time. It was just after
his father’s death. But his foster father had
never told him that the trip concerned him or his
father’s farm.</p>

<p>“What difference did that make?” asked Bud.</p>

<p>“Made jest this. Ole Bill Reed died, and there
wa’nt really no good deed to your pa. He was
dead, too, then. The place was yours because
your pa paid for it with hard cash, but the title
was bad. Ain’t no one ever goin’ to buy the
place from you—an’ its worth a hundred dollars
a acre now o’ any man’s money, lessen you go
get your title cleared up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Bud smiled.</p>

<p>“That all sounds right,” he said, “and I
reckon I ought to understand it. But I don’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Camp laughed, too, and looked at his wife.</p>

<p>“Lawyer Stockwell understands it all right,
mother,” he said chuckling. “It’s this way,
Son. There’s only two persons who kin give
you a clean title to that land which you heired
from your pa. An’ that’s them as is Ole Bill
Reed’s heirs. An’ ef you want to know who
them air, it’s Jack Stanley an’ his wife.”</p>

<p>Bud sat up trying to understand.</p>

<p>“Ef any one has claims on that farm besides
you,” Mr. Camp continued, “it’s John Reed and
his wife. An’ they ain’t got no genoine claim
except to do the fair and square thing and that’s
what ole Bill and his wife didn’t. Ef they’re
your friends, they’ll do it. An’ when they do
an’ give you a deed to what your pa hones’ly
paid fur, Bud Wilson’ll have as clean an’ tidy
a bit o’ ground as they is in Scott County.”</p>

<p>The boy’s brow was wrinkled.</p>

<p>“You say my foster father understands?
What do you mean? How is he interested in all
this?”</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to make reflections,” said
Mr. Camp slowly, “but lawyers has more tricks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
an’ one. I ain’t sayin’ he’d do it. But what ef
he or some one else’d buy that sixty acres o’
Jack Stanley. Where’d you come in?”</p>

<p>“I see,” answered Bud, “but I can’t think
you’re right. Any way,” he added, “I’ll keep
my eyes open. As for this,” and he whirled the
dull, brassy circle on his finger, “I guess it’s
workin’ all right. It ain’t brought me anything
bad yet—exceptin’ my muddy pants and the
swamp.”</p>

<p>Mr. Camp’s return to the house had been
prompted by curiosity. When Bud had asked
a few more questions about his father and the
farm, Mr. Camp suggested that it would be well
to hurry to the stranded aeroplane.</p>

<p>“Will you help me?” asked Bud eagerly.</p>

<p>“Will we?” answered Josh, speaking for his
father and himself. “When a real show comes
right out here in our front yard without no
charge to see it—I guess we’ll see it ef we have
to shet down the mill.”</p>

<p>“It’s most as good as goin’ to the fair,”
chuckled his father.</p>

<p>Mrs. Camp gave a sigh of disappointment.</p>

<p>“You ain’t a goin’ to miss it, Mrs. Camp,”
spoke up Bud promptly. “I’m goin’ to start
back to town about twenty minutes of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
o’clock. You be waitin’ out in the yard. I’ll
sail right over the house. Don’t be scared if I
come close to you. I’ll do it so you can see the
airship.”</p>

<p>“I jes can’t nacherly believe it,” exclaimed
the good-natured woman.</p>

<p>“And if you’ll let me, I’ll come back and stay
with you again to-night,” added Bud. “That is,
if you’ll let me pay for my board an’ lodgin’.”</p>

<p>“Pay?” exclaimed Mrs. Camp indignantly.</p>

<p>“Come on and quit your foolish talk,” added
her husband.</p>

<p>A curious and laughable sight in his borrowed
clothes, Bud, Josh and Mr. Camp set out for the
lake.</p>

<p>“She’s right down among the cattails,” explained
Josh. “An’ mighty nigh in the pond.
You had a close call a gittin’ ducked.”</p>

<p>This was true, as Bud soon discovered. The
day was fine, with only a light September haze in
the air. Standing on the slope of the hill—which
completely concealed the machine from a
possible traveler on the wood road—Bud and
the two Camps began speculating on the best
way to approach the aeroplane. No one was
anxious to plow through the deep mire of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
swamp unless it was necessary. The solution
was easy.</p>

<p>The skiff and flat boat were moored at the bottom
of the pond near the closed head-gate. To
reach these, there was a board path or footway
running along the flume from the creek. A half
mile detour brought the party there. In a few
moments more, they were all at the dam and the
boats. Bud had explained his plans for moving
the aeroplane by loading it onto the boats and
floating it to the head of the flume. Mr. Camp
reckoned the project feasible.</p>

<p>But, when the two boats had been brought as
near the stranded machine as they would float,
and Bud, stripped of his trousers, underclothes,
shoes and socks, had crawled through the weeds
and mud to the airship, his fears were realized.
Although the starboard end of the car was partly
buried in the mud, the keen-eyed lad at once discovered
that the bottom cross piece of the frame
was broken.</p>

<p>Making further examination of the craft, his
eye fell upon the gasoline tank. A sudden alarm
came over him. He knew he had enough fuel to
carry him safely back to the fair-grounds; but
that would not suit all his needs. He meant to
return to the fair, give the advertised exhibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
by flying three times around the race-track, and
then escape once more. If he could do this, he
would keep the aeroplane hidden until the next
day, which was Saturday. When he returned
that day, he would come down. The fair would
be over.</p>

<p>But to do this meant more gasoline. He returned
to his waiting friends and reported.
There was a hasty consultation, and this program
was agreed upon: Josh was to hook up a horse
to the spring wagon and proceed at once to Little
Town for five gallons of gasoline; Bud was to
return to the mill and secure a few pieces of wood
and some wire to repair the broken cross piece;
Mr. Camp was to stay by the aeroplane and clear
away the interfering weeds as well as he could.</p>

<p>“And,” volunteered Mr. Camp, as the boys
left, “sense we’re all a goin’ to be workin’ purty
hard this mornin’ tell Mother to get us up a
pot-pie dinner with mashed potatoes. Ef any
one asts fur me at the mill, tell ’em we’re shet
down.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>A UNIQUE STARTING DEVICE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Anyway,” exclaimed Bud, after he had returned
with his supplies and made another examination
of the aeroplane, “the engine is in
good shape. The landing skids kept it above the
weeds and it’s as dry as a bone.”</p>

<p>Half naked, the boy went to work on the airship,
and, with no little annoyance from mosquitoes
and sunburn, he soon had the broken cross-piece
mended.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the two mill hands had managed
to secure a couple of substantial fence planks,
each about ten feet long. While Bud tested each
brace in the car—fortunately the front and rear
rudders and the two propellers escaped without
a scratch—Mr. Camp and his hands beat down
the tangle of cattails and flags. By using the
fence boards to walk on, a temporary tramway
was made and when the busy young aviator
was ready to move his car, the planks were laid
ready for the first ten-foot lift.</p>

<p>“Now then,” called out Mr. Camp, as the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
men and Bud took their places, “right up to
yer shoulder and then all together.”</p>

<p>With Mr. Camp and Bud in front and the
others just behind them—all standing on the narrow
boards—they slowly raised the frame into
the air. At the end of the improvised walk, the
car was gently eased to the beaten-down weeds
and the boards were shoved forward. Again, the
aeroplane was lifted and carried another ten feet.
The next lift would bring the frame to the
water’s edge.</p>

<p>Before this was made, Bud lined up the two
boats about fifteen feet apart and anchored them
between oars and sticks stuck in the mud. Then,
every one removing his shoes and trousers, the
airship squad got its shoulders under the machine
once more, and, splashing and slipping in
the shallow water and mud, carefully laid the
aeroplane on the boats.</p>

<p>“This is all new business to me,” said Mr.
Camp, slapping at the mosquitoes, thick on his
unprotected legs, “but I’m ketchin’ on. An’
I got an idee a’ready,” he added knowingly. “I
see what you’re figgerin’ on, Bud. Ef ye git
back here to-night, don’t land on the marsh.
Ef ye’ll jest make a landin’ over yender on the
slope o’ the hill ye can git out o’ all this trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I’d have as much trouble gettin’ the car
over to the flume to raise it again,” suggested
Bud.</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re mistaken, an’ that’s
where my idee comes in. I reckon ye <em>kin</em> start
in the flume, but that’s fur frum bein’ the easiest
way.”</p>

<p>“What would you do?” asked Bud, with
rather a patronizing smile.</p>

<p>“Well, as I figger it out,” said Mr. Camp,
parting his flowing beard to expectorate, “all ye
want is a run fur yer money. There’s more
ways o’ gettin’ a runnin’ start than on a boat.
When you git back to-night, I’ll have an old
spring wagon I got up thar nigh the top o’ the
hill. An’ I’ll have her greased good an’ plenty.
Tomorrer we’ll put the flying-machine on the
wagon an’ Josh in the shafts. When he gits goin’
down hill ef he don’t beat this ole flat-boat I’m
a liar.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Camp,” laughed Bud, approvingly, “if
it wasn’t for gettin’ the aeroplane over the
marsh and on the hill, I’d try it to-day. That’s
a bird of a way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m purty handy that away,” remarked
the mill owner in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Camp and one of the men climbed into the
boats to balance the long frame, while the other
man and Bud, keeping within wading distance
of the shore, began the task of pushing the boats
the quarter of a mile or more to the dam. Before
they reached the lower end of the pond,
Josh could be seen making his way laboriously
up the plank walk along the flume, pushing a
wheelbarrow loaded with the wood-encased can
of gasoline.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon, and, by the time the aeroplane
had been lifted from its floating foundation
and deposited safely upon the clay dam or
levee, the distant but welcome sound of Mr.
Camp’s dinner bell could be heard.</p>

<p>“There don’t seem to be any risk in leaving
it here,” suggested Bud. “There isn’t a living
thing in sight except birds. And, anyway, I’ve
got to get my clothes, to say nothing of that
chicken potpie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Josh doubtfully.
“Mebbe I better stay. They been a telephonin’
ever’ where ’bout a lost flyin’ machine.
Somebody called up the store in Little Town this
mornin’ while I was there, astin’ ef any one had
heerd o’ a lost flyin’ machine.”</p>

<p>Bud showed some alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be skeered, son,” exclaimed Mr.
Camp. “Thet ain’t because they think it’s up
this way. They probable been telephonin’ all
over the county.”</p>

<p>It was finally agreed that Josh should remain
on guard, and that his dinner should be brought
to him. After getting into their clothes, the
others started for the house. On the way, Bud
was in a deep study. He had no concern about
his return to the fair-ground and no fear but
what he would give a successful exhibition, but
what was to follow? Certainly Attorney Stockwell
and Mr. Dare and the deputy sheriff would
be on the watch for him.</p>

<p>And, if they were looking out for the stolen
aeroplane, they would not only see it approaching,
but they would see the direction it took on
leaving. On a fast horse, a man might almost
keep close enough on the track of the retreating
car to see it come down. After that, it might
be only a question of a few hours search. You
can’t well hide a forty-foot wide expanse of
white canvas.</p>

<p>“Mr. Camp,” said Bud, at last, as they hurried
along over the wood road, “you figured out
that starting apparatus so well, maybe you can
help me out of some other trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>He related his predicament as he saw it. The
old man wagged his jaws and stroked his long
whiskers.</p>

<p>“Gimme a little time,” he replied at last.
“That’s a purty tough problem, but mebbe I kin
git some answer to it.”</p>

<p>At the house, it was like a holiday.</p>

<p>“Seems jes like Sunday with the mill shet
down,” remarked Mrs. Camp, opening a can of
pickled pears. “You all git ready right away.
Dinner’s all dryin’ up.”</p>

<p>Bud changed his clothes—Mrs. Camp had even
pressed his pants—and the four men soused and
scrubbed themselves, and all took turns with
the hanging comb. Then they filed in to dinner.
It wasn’t a question of light or dark meat of the
chicken with Mr. Camp when he served the pot-pie.
The half spoon and half dipper plunged into
the smoking soup tureen came up charged with
gravy, dumplings and meat. Into the center of
this, went the mashed potatoes, with butter melting
on top of the pile.</p>

<p>In the midst of the dinner, Mr. Camp suddenly
balanced his knife on his hand, struck the table
with the butt of his fork and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I’ve got her, Bud.”</p>

<p>“Got what, Pa?” broke in Mrs. Camp, nervously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
as she sprang up and looked into the pot-pie
bowl.</p>

<p>Her husband smiled, pounded the table again,
and went on:</p>

<p>“Sure as shootin’, Bud, them fellers is agoin’
to foller you. Mebbe you could go right back
there to the lake an’ never be discivered, and
mebbe not. ’Tain’t no use takin’ chances. Jest
you hold yer horses, finish yer pie, an’ I’ll put
a bug in yer ear.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a way to hide me?” exclaimed
Bud eagerly.</p>

<p>“I hev that. An’ it’s simple as A. B. C.”</p>

<p>With most profuse thanks to Mrs. Camp for all
she had done for him and many promises to
come and see her later if anything prevented his
return that night, Bud took farewell of his hostess.
The men had already left with Josh’s dinner.
Out in the open space between the dooryard
and the mill, Mr. Camp, helping himself to an
ample supply of Kentucky twist, explained to
Bud the details of his plan for concealing the
aeroplane that night. It did not have to be told
twice. The exuberant boy chuckled with delight.</p>

<p>“Mr. Camp,” exclaimed Bud, “if I ever get
my farm, I’m goin’ to buy an aeroplane. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
goin’ to be a two-seater, too. An’ the first passenger
’at rides with me’ll be you.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” replied the farmer mill owner,
twisting a lock of his whiskers about his horny
finger and shaking his head, “don’t you worry
about me bein’ afeered.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t an hour after the working squad
reached the dam and head gates again until the
aeroplane was ready for flight. The gasoline tank
was full, the oil cups were charged and the engine—to
the joy of Mr. Camp and his hands—had
been tested and found in order. The flat
boat had been lifted over the head-gate and was
on the flume ready to dart away upon the rushing
flood of water when the head-gate was raised.
Finally, the bird-like framework had been balanced
on the thwarts of the flat boat, and nothing
remain but to wait for the time to start.</p>

<p>It was then a quarter after two o’clock. Nearly
a half hour remained before leaving time. In
spite of the plan proposed by Mr. Camp, Bud, it
was further suggested, ought to lose no opportunity
to mislead his almost certain pursuers.
This meant that he should arrange his flight from
the fair-grounds so that he would head west.
That would take him away from Scottsville and
toward a bit of low ground about four miles west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of the fair-ground. Both sides of this were
heavily timbered.</p>

<p>“Ef ye kin git down thar in the ‘slashins’
afore they git too clost to ye,” explained Mr.
Camp, “an’ it ain’t too dangersome to git clost
to the groun’, ye kin make a quick turn an’
shoot along in the valley till ye come to the ole
Little Town road. An’ that’ll take ye furder in
the hills. Like as not ye kin git clean away unbeknownst
to ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try it,” exclaimed Bud. “But I reckon
it don’t matter much. We got ’em cinched if
I ever get back here. And I’ll be here about a
quarter to four,” he added.</p>

<p>Mr. Camp’s plan did credit to the old man’s
ingenuity. This is how he explained it to Bud:</p>

<p>“Ye see the saw house down there?” he began.
“Well, sir, ’at’s fifty feet long, or more.
An’ ye see that track? They’s a car ’at runs on
that to haul the logs into the shed to be sawed.
When ye git back, ye’ll come right here and
land afore the mill. Me an’ Josh an’ the hands’ll
be waitin’ an’ the log car’ll be all ready. Afore
ye kin say Jack Robison, we’ll have thet flying-machine
on the log car an’ in the shed.”</p>

<p>“And the doors closed,” added Bud enthusiastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not by no means. That would be suspicious
like ’cause they ain’t never shet. This afternoon,
they’ll be two pulleys rigged up in the comb o’
the shed all ready to yank the flyin’-machine up
agin the roof—clear o’ the car.”</p>

<p>“But they’ll see it!”</p>

<p>“They’ll be some pieces o’ timber all sawed
to run acrost under the machine like as if it was
a kind of a second floor. An’ they’ll be plenty
o’ loose boards all stacked to lay on them jice.
I been kind o’ needin’ a attic there any way,”
laughed the grizzled mill owner. “An’ ef them
jice is old timber an’ the floor is old boards, I
reckon ain’t no one goin’ to suspicion it’s all
been made suddent like. An’ it don’t ’pear to
me any one’s goin’ to take the trouble to look
up in the attic fur no airplane.”</p>

<p>It was at this point that Bud had chuckled.
Then his enthusiasm cooled.</p>

<p>“How about getting another start?” he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>Mr. Camp chuckled in turn.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you about the hill and the
spring wagon and Josh for a engine?”</p>

<p>“And we’ll carry it over there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a><br />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_166">The Start from the Flume.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166-<br />167]</a></span></p>

<p>“The log wagon can be made thirty feet long,”
drawled Mr. Camp with another laugh. “We’ll
haul it there like one o’ them poles they raise at
the rallies.”</p>

<p>As these details were gone over again, the old
mill owner kept a close eye on his thick silver
watch. At twenty-five minutes of three, he arose
with the importance of Dewey at Manila.</p>

<p>“Well, Bud,” he exclaimed, extending his
gnarled hand—his jaws working vigorously, as
they always did in moments of excitement,
“time’s up. An’ good luck to ye.”</p>

<p>It was an exhilarating moment for Bud. Stationing
Josh and one of the men at either end of
the balanced airship, he knocked the block from
under the front of the flat boat, while the other
mill hands held the stern of the boat. Then,
tightening his hat, Bud took his seat, and rapidly
tested all levers.</p>

<p>“Hold on, boys,” he said soberly, “until I
yell ‘Go.’”</p>

<p>“Air ye all ready?” exclaimed Mr. Camp
standing over the head-gate with the lever that
swung it up in his hand.</p>

<p>Bud turned in his seat, set the engine going,
and then watched the propellers begin to whirl.
As their speed increased and the car began to
tremble, he said in a low voice to Mr. Camp:</p>

<p>“Turn her on!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>As the heavy-muscled man threw himself upon
the lever and the gates slowly rose, the banked
up water rolled out beneath them like a wave of
oil. As the released flood shot under the car,
Bud was firm in his seat, both hands on the levers.
There was a bob of the flat boat upward,
and the boy shouted, “Go!”</p>

<p>For a moment only, the boat seemed to pause
like a chip on the brink of an angry waterfall,
and then, carried upon the crest of the new torrent,
it shot forward like a rock falling. There
was time only for a few swift blows on the sides
of the flume, and then the aeroplane, rising from
the impetus of its unique flight, leaped forward
and began to rise. Bud did not turn, but he
waved his hand in jubilation. The airship was
safely afloat.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>AN EXHIBITION UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It would require considerable space to describe
what took place when President Josiah
Elder reached the fair-ground, after receiving
Bud’s message, and found the airship shed
empty. A good share of his anger he took out
on poor Jim Hoarr, the watchman. And yet,
Jim could give no better explanation than that
Bud Wilson had suddenly appeared, out of
breath, a short time before, handed him the message,
and sent him on the run to the telephone in
the ticket office.</p>

<p>Mr. Elder then read the message at first hand.
After that, while he still berated the watchman,
he began to think. What did it all mean? Who
were “they?” And why were “they” attempting
to take the aeroplane. After all, it could
mean only one thing. It must mean Mr. Dare.
The angered expert was probably up to some
trick. And if he was, the thing had probably
not yet been attempted. Sending his horse and
buggy away, the fair official withdrew to the airship
shed, dropped the front curtain, lit a cigar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and sat down to await developments. Under a
box, he hid a lighted lantern.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock he was rewarded. Under
instructions, the watchman remained quiet, when
stealthy footsteps approached and the front curtain
was raised. Waiting until three figures had
crawled into the shed, Mr. Elder suddenly drew
his lantern from its shelter. Before him stood
the discomfited Attorney Stockwell, Mr. T. Glenn
Dare and the deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>“Good evening, gentlemen,” exclaimed the
waiting president. “Anything I can do for
you?”</p>

<p>Attorney Stockwell put on a bold front. At
the same time, he looked about in open surprise.
The aeroplane was gone.</p>

<p>“We’re here on an order of the Court, Josiah,”
began the lawyer. “I’ve been retained
by Mr. Dare to protect his rights.”</p>

<p>“What rights?”</p>

<p>“That’s not for me to pass on. It’s in the
hands of the Court. Mr. Dare has made affidavit
that the aeroplane we bought hasn’t been paid
for, and that he’s entitled to its possession. The
Court, so far, agrees with him. The officer of the
Court is here with a writ to take charge of the
apparatus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” replied Mr. Elder. “Help yourself.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary for me to say this is no
laughing matter, Josiah. It ain’t what you and
me think. The Court has ordered the sheriff to
take charge of the machine.”</p>

<p>“I recognize the power of the Court,” responded
the president. “I shan’t interfere.”</p>

<p>“If you knew of this writ and have concealed
Mr. Dare’s property, of course, you know you
can be cited for contempt.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know of it, and I haven’t concealed
the aeroplane,” answered Mr. Elder, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” demanded the lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Elder shook his head.</p>

<p>“Some one stole it,” he added, with an increasing
smile.</p>

<p>“Stole it?” exclaimed the lawyer and Mr.
Dare together.</p>

<p>“This is all I know about it,” added Mr. Elder.
“And you are entitled to know it, too, as a
director of the fair.”</p>

<p>He handed the perplexed and angry lawyer
Bud’s note. Attorney Stockwell read it, Mr.
Dare looking over his shoulder. When he had
finished, the lawyer, white with sudden anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
folded the bit of paper and put it into his vest
pocket.</p>

<p>“You’ll notice, Stockwell, that that note is
addressed to me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just keep it as evidence. It may come in
handy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder slowly put his lantern on the ground
and then stepped close to the lawyer’s side.
Holding out his hand he said, in a tone that
made Jim, the watchman, also step forward:</p>

<p>“Hand me that note.”</p>

<p>The lawyer stepped back. Then he weakened.
Drawing the scrap of paper from his pocket,
he handed it to his fellow director.</p>

<p>“Are you backin’ him up in this?”</p>

<p>“Stockwell,” answered Mr. Elder, “in the last
two or three days, I’ve seen a good deal of your
adopted son, and to-night, I’ve seen a good deal
of you. I don’t know any more about what Bud
has done or is going to do than this note tells.
But I do know this. From this time on, when it
comes to ‘backin’ him up, I think I’ll back him
in any fight he makes against you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” sneered the lawyer. “All I
can say is, you’re goin’ to have your hands full.
An’ you can begin your meddlin’ just the minute
this young thief lands on these grounds to-morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
He’ll be arrested and charged with larceny.
If you interfere, I’ll give you all the
fight you want.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder turned to the silent expert.</p>

<p>“I ought to tell you, Mr. Dare,” he said, ignoring
the lawyer’s threat, “that I telegraphed
to your company to-day all the facts concerning
your conduct. I also sent them a draft for the cost
of the aeroplane, minus your fee. If they won’t
settle on that basis, you are welcome to the property.”
Then he laughed, “The next time you
have a job like this and think you can come a
confidence game on the country jakes, you’d better
select some town that hasn’t a Bud Wilson in
it.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Mr. Dare,” said Attorney Stockwell
pompously, “this fight’s just began. We’ll
have our innings to-morrow. There’ll be no exhibition
of our property on Saturday, at least.
And that’s the big day.”</p>

<p>“If there isn’t,” replied Mr. Elder, good naturedly,
“it’ll be the first day your foster son
has fallen down. He seems a little swift for you,
Cyrus.”</p>

<p>Before Mr. Elder could say more, the lawyer
and his two companions stalked out of the shed.</p>

<p>It was always a question in Scottsville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
whether Friday or Saturday would be the banner
day at the fair. From the looks of the
grounds at ten o’clock the next morning, it was
apparent that either the fine weather, good crops,
or the aeroplane was working wonders. The enclosure
was packed. Men, women and children
swayed back and forth; ice cream, candy, “hoky
poky,” peanuts, toy balloons, whips, “tin-types,”
photographs, dusty shoes all told that
the fair was in full swing. The “Wheel of Fortune”
operators; the barkers at the “side
shows;” the cries of the hatted Wild West young
men who besought onlookers to “hit a baby and
get a seegar,” or informed others vociferously
that “the cane you ring is the cane you get,”
made a hubbub the endless keynote of which
was the shrill organ at the “merry-go-round.”</p>

<p>“She’ll run twelve thousand people to-day,”
suggested Superintendent Perry to President Josiah
Elder as the two came out of the ticket office.</p>

<p>“And half of ’em are here to see our flyin’-machine,”
answered Mr. Elder. “What do you
’spose that kid’s expectin’ to do?”</p>

<p>“What are <em>you</em> expectin’ to do?” answered
the superintendent, with a half smile. “Ye
don’t need to fear but he’ll be here. But after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
his show—what then? Ye kin be sure Stockwell’ll
be ready to grab the outfit. An’ then—how
about to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder shook his head. Then he explained
to Mr. Perry what the directors had done in the
matter of offering to settle with the manufacturers.</p>

<p>“We’ve telegraphed them that our eighteen
hundred dollars is on the way, and told ’em how
this expert o’ theirs fell down. We’re expectin’
an answer any time to-day callin’ him off. If
it don’t come, we’ll fight ’em as best we can.
But we’re all agreed we ain’t a goin’ to be held
up. We won’t pay Mr. T. Glenn Dare one cent.
He can break up the show to-morrow, but we
won’t weaken.”</p>

<p>At two o’clock it looked as if another person
could hardly be crowded into the fair-grounds—at
least, not near the exhibition buildings and
concession tents. With the first tap of the bell in
the judge’s stand, like a field of snow slipping in
a body down a mountain side, the heaving mass
of humanity moved toward the race track. The
five hundred dollar purse for the two-twenty pace
marked the big feature of the speed contests and
a new record was set for “grandstand” receipts.</p>

<p>But three men were not concerning themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
with this event. Sitting complacently together,
on a knoll under the only trees within the race
track, were Attorney Cyrus Stockwell, T. Glenn
Dare, the aviator, and Deputy Sheriff Pusey.
They were waiting to see how Bud Wilson was
going to keep his word. One heat of the big
race, delayed as usual, had been run, and the
first heat of the next event “green trotters without
a record” had been disposed of when two
other men left the judges’ stand and made their
way toward the empty airship shed or “aerodrome.”
These were President Elder and Superintendent
Perry. They were the reverse of complacent.</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes of three o’clock and
the space about the aeroplane house was black
with people. Jim Hoarr, the watchman, keeping
the canvas front of the shed closed to conceal
the fact that there was no aeroplane within the
house, wondered what would happen when the
curious crowd learned that the house about
which they were crowded was empty.</p>

<p>As the packed spectators gave way before Superintendent
Perry’s badge, Attorney Stockwell
and his friends fell in the wake of the president
and superintendent. The little party reached
the shed together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Josiah,” exclaimed the lawyer,
touching his fellow director on the arm.
“You see we’re right on time. I hope Bud
makes good his promise.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder scowled.</p>

<p>“If he don’t,” continued Attorney Stockwell,
“what explanation are you going to make? I
see you have quite an audience.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand about him, to include perhaps
ten thousand persons who had paid their
money to see the airship.</p>

<p>Mr. Elder looked at his watch, swept the horizon
with his eyes and scowled again. It was just
three o’clock. “I reckon you’re in it as deep
as I am, as far as the crowd knows,” the president
finally replied, in a low voice. “I—”</p>

<p>A sudden murmur ran through the surging
crowd. Mr. Elder paused and looked quickly
about. He saw nothing approaching, but before
he could continue, an arm shot out from the field
of spectators and pointed almost directly overhead.
Then the mass of people began to melt
away with thousands of “Ahs,” and “Ohs” and
“There she comes.”</p>

<p>At least fifteen hundred feet in the air, Bud’s
stolen aeroplane was rushing forward to make
its advertised exhibition. Where it had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
from, no one seemed to know. Not one of the
men most interested had seen it until that moment,
and it was swooping down upon the fair-grounds
as if it had come from above the clouds.
So high was it that, at the angle it was traveling,
it had to pass over the grounds. The sight set
the crowd off in a frenzy of excitement. In a
cloud of dust, the eager spectators ran forward
as if to follow the aeroplane. In its wake were
the lawyer, his client, and the deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>Mr. Elder stood as if transfixed.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll wait developments right here,”
he said, turning to Jim Hoarr. “Get the shed
ready.”</p>

<p>“I seen it,” said Jim, “but I thought it was a
bird.”</p>

<p>“Where did he come from?” asked the fair
official.</p>

<p>“Plumb out o’ the north, but about a mile
high. An’ it sailed right over the ground afore
it turned. Not fur me,” added Jim, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>Having passed out over the grounds again, the
aeroplane was seen sweeping in a long curve
on the turn. The scrambling crowd slackened,
and the airship, five hundred feet above the trees,
headed back again. For an instant, it darted upward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and then, settling once more, made a curving
swing toward the waiting thousands.</p>

<p>“Here she comes,” rose in a deafening roar.</p>

<p>Bud’s face could be made out for the first time.
It wore neither smile nor alarm. It was as placid
as marble. With his feet close together in his
stirrups, his body erect and tense, his blue flannel
shirt fluttering in the breeze, he held his
course with the ease of a locomotive engineer.</p>

<p>“Now,” exclaimed Attorney Stockwell to
Deputy Pusey, “get your writ ready an’ keep
your eyes peeled. Nab him the minute he
lights.”</p>

<p>Once over the mob of upturned faces—gathered
now mainly on the long stretch of the race-track—Bud’s
body swayed and his machine
veered. In another moment, the aeroplane had
altered its course and was on its way circling
the grounds just above the track. Ten thousand
people rushed forward in spontaneous excitement.
Just off the track, Attorney Stockwell
watched, breathed hard, and waited.</p>

<p>On the back stretch of the track, the aeroplane
sank lower and lower until by the time the upper
turn was reached, it was just over the heads
of the spectators. Then, came the flight down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the track, over the crowd and in front of the
grand-stand.</p>

<p>“I’ll show ’em I can travel where I please,”
said Bud to himself. “Hold on to your hats,”
he yelled suddenly, as he smiled for the first
time.</p>

<p>With a dart, the car skimmed toward the jam
of humanity like a swallow skims over a pond.
Falling over each other, pushing, knocking and
yelling, the crowd attempted to clear the track.
There was a crash, and, as Bud swept onward,
not over twenty feet above the ground, the track
fence gave way, and the panic stricken crowd
sank in confused heaps.</p>

<p>“Keep off the track,” yelled Bud warningly.</p>

<p>From the judges’ stand, the figure of Superintendent
Perry suddenly leaped forward. In
his hand, he waved his big black hat warningly.</p>

<p>“Git back there, git back,” he called in a loud
voice. “Git back, an’ keep back, or some one’ll
get killed.”</p>

<p>At that instant, the aeroplane, like a yacht in
a gale, swept by the grand-stand. There was the
low hum of propellers, and the whirr of the engine,
but not a creak from the car itself, and not
a word or look from the gritty young aviator.
A buzz of relieved admiration seemed to rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
like a breeze from the grand-stand, the thousands
on the dust deep race-track caught their breath,
and Bud had passed. His first circuit of the
course had been made.</p>

<p>From the airship house on the center of the
track, three figures were rushing forward. They
had just made a discovery.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stockwell,” Deputy Pusey had suddenly
exclaimed as he saw Bud enter on his second lap,
“do you know what he’s a goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>The attorney had just suspected, but he was
watching the flying car as if fascinated.</p>

<p>“He’s goin’ to beat us after all,” shouted the
deputy, grabbing the lawyer’s arm. “He ain’t
a goin’ to land. He’s a goin’ to fly away agin.”</p>

<p>An awful word came from Mr. T. Glenn Dare’s
lips, and Attorney Stockwell, his face red with
new anger, sprang forward as if to intercept the
flying boy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE ENEMY OUTWITTED ONCE MORE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Just within the race-track enclosure and in the
shade of the judges’ stand, stood Deputy Sheriff
Pusey’s side-bar buggy and his famous roadster.
The rig was known all over the county. Its appearance
usually meant the service of a writ, a
subpoena or a warrant. It was a forlorn hope,
but, before the aeroplane had reached the far
end of the track again, the deputy and Attorney
Stockwell were in the buggy and the county official,
his big official badge blazing on his blue
coat and his official voice demanding that the
crowd give way, were forcing a path through
the packed crowd.</p>

<p>Before the horse could make much headway,
the aeroplane was racing down the “stretch”
once more—this time even nearer the ground.
As the whirr of the engine struck on the horse’s
ears and the wide white planes of the car filled
the width of the track just above, the horse
reared, lunged forward, and the aeroplane had
passed once more.</p>

<p>“Hello,” rang out from the aeroplane at once.
“Want me, Mr. Stockwell?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a mutter of enraged words in the
buggy, and then, the crowd, alarmed at the
horse’s actions, fell back in confusion. With a
quick command, the lawyer spoke to his companion,
and, with a glance at the aeroplane, already
on the far side of the race-track on its next
round, the frightened horse was forced through
the crowd toward the head of the “stretch” down
which the flying-machine would come on its next
lap.</p>

<p>The turn was reached just before Bud arrived
from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Now, Pusey,” exclaimed the lawyer, grabbing
the lines and whirling the horse about, “get
on the seat and serve him ef you can. Get your
writ ready. Ef he comes clost enough, grab him
and hold on. I’ll take care of the horse.”</p>

<p>Attorney Stockwell, whip in hand, headed the
rearing animal down the track, yelling to the
crowd to get out of the way. The massed people
saw what was coming. Between the low-flying
aeroplane and the galloping horse, a second injunction
was not needed. As the track opened
up before the snorting animal, already on a dead
run, with its ears laid back, Deputy Pusey
sprang to the seat of the buggy, and began to
wave his writ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Bud understood the situation as well as if it
had been explained to him. A provoking smile
came on his face, and with a reckless daring he
headed the car straight at the deputy’s head.
Down the stretch together, came the foaming,
galloping horse and the swiftly moving aeroplane.
Holding with one hand to Attorney
Stockwell’s shoulder, the deputy sheriff—he had
already lost his official hat—waved his writ and
yelled:</p>

<p>“Hey, there, Bud Wilson, <a href="#image01">in the name of the
law, Stop!</a>”</p>

<p>“Busy,” cried out Bud. “See you to-morrow.
Can’t stop to-day.”</p>

<p>“You’re under arrest,” shouted Attorney
Stockwell.</p>

<p>The temptation was too great. Without answering,
Bud gave the horizontal rudder a slight
turn, and the speeding car shot at the deputy’s
wobbling form.</p>

<p>“Grab him,” shouted the lawyer, as the car
dropped.</p>

<p>Spurred on by the jeers and hoots of the thousands
watching the strange contest, the county
officer made a feeble effort to respond. As he
threw his body up in a half-hearted effort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
catch the car, now just overhead, the aeroplane
sprang up once more.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” shouted Bud, “you’re too slow.
See you later.”</p>

<p>Deputy Pusey balanced himself for a second,
and then tumbled forward between the foam-flecked
horse and the light buggy. A dozen men
grabbed the bridle of the horse, and the lawyer,
with an effort pulled the deputy into the buggy.</p>

<p>As the machine sped by the judges’ stand,
Bud heard a voice:</p>

<p>“Good boy, Bud,” it sounded jubilantly.</p>

<p>Bud glanced quickly, and saw President Elder,
Superintendent Perry, and a crowd of other
laughing and excited fair officials.</p>

<p>“Be back at three o’clock to-morrow,” sang
out the boy in response.</p>

<p>In another instant, his obedient craft was on
the lower turn, and, with the shouts and cheers of
the assembled multitude ringing in his ears, Bud
prepared to make his escape. At the extreme
end of the track, he threw the lever of the vertical
rudder over so sharply that the car almost
capsized. Like a bird with a wounded wing,
the framework fell partly on its side. Bud’s
heart thumped. The ground seemed rushing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to meet him. To even scrape the surface meant
ruin to the car.</p>

<p>The boy retained his presence of mind and did
the right thing. But the car had lost so much
headway that it did not respond at once. It
wavered, tried to recover itself and then, almost
balanced, fell within five or six feet of the earth.
Escape did not seem possible. The aeroplane
was yet on an angle, and the low end of the frame
was just escaping the ground. If it struck, Bud’s
work was over. Like lightning, the thought
came to him that he must jump to escape the
wreckage.</p>

<p>Just then, with the spring of an animal, a man’s
crouched form hurled itself from the ground beneath
the dragging end. Bud’s dry lips tried to
cry out, but there was no time. His eye was
quicker than his tongue. He saw the bronzed
face of Jack Stanley, his gypsy friend, but no
sound came from the boy’s lips. As the gypsy’s
face flashed before him, something seemed to
strike the car. A shock ran through the frame,
and then, as if caught by a gale of wind, the
dragging end of the frame flew up—the aeroplane,
gathering speed, darted ahead, and the
ship righting herself, began once more to climb
skyward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go it, Kid—yer all right!”</p>

<p>These words followed after Bud as he renewed
his flight, and he realized that once again Jack
Stanley had helped him over a crisis. Or, was
it Madame Zecatacas’ magic ring?</p>

<p>“If it’s the ring,” thought Bud, “I’m goin’
to have still more use fur it. It’s got to make
Jack and his wife sign the deed for me.”</p>

<p>Straight west over the “aerodrome,” the aeroplane
took its new course as steadily and easily
as if had not just escaped destruction. Several
hundred feet in the air, Bud set the car on a level
keel headed for the “slashings”—the valley
some miles ahead.</p>

<p>He was well out of the grounds when Attorney
Stockwell and the deputy untangled themselves
from the dense crowd. But at no time, was he
out of the lawyer’s sight. To the indignation
of the spectators, Mr. Stockwell forced the deputy’s
horse through the crowd and hurried toward
the fair-ground entrance. There was no
rear entrance leading in the direction Bud had
flown, and in hastening to the main gate, the
buggy had nearly a half mile to cover before
passing from the enclosure. This was under
trees and behind buildings that at once cut off
the view of the disappearing aeroplane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The road leading to the fair-grounds from the
main thoroughfare or pike, ran north. Finally
reaching the east-and-west road, the deputy’s
horse was put to a run. It was then a half mile
further before the flying car could possibly be
seen, as, for that distance, the main road ran
between trees. It was not until ten minutes
after the excited lawyer and the bruised deputy
had started on their chase that they came out
into the open road.</p>

<p>“There he goes,” exclaimed Deputy Pusey,
when they did.</p>

<p>“Giddap,” shouted the lawyer, hitting the already
galloping animal with the end of the lines.
“He’s goin’ like all sixty.”</p>

<p>Almost directly ahead, and perhaps four miles
away, the aeroplane hung like a bird. Without
knowledge of what it really was, the object could
not have been picked out for other than a bird
in flight.</p>

<p>“I’m afeered he’s given us the slip,” added
the deputy.</p>

<p>“He ain’t goin’ far,” replied the panting lawyer,
still slapping the already jaded horse.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” sang out his companion.
“He’s lightin’ a’ready.”</p>

<p>It seemed that this was true. The aeroplane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
which was no great distance in the air, was dropping
slowly toward a distant line of trees.</p>

<p>“Comin’ down in the woods,” said Attorney
Stockwell.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that the aidge o’ the ‘slashins’?” exclaimed
the deputy.</p>

<p>“Looks like it. Well, there ain’t any place
there to hide. It’s all marsh or medder or underbrush,”
argued the lawyer. “Anyway, keep
your eyes peeled to see ’at he don’t come up
again on the fur side.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, the pursuers mounted
the high ground concealing the valley beyond.
There was a final quick dash down the gully road,
and the low ground spread out before them. The
aeroplane was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“Well,” began the deputy, “there ye are—all
for nothin’.”</p>

<p>The lawyer pointed his whip ahead. An old
man, apparently in charge of a solitary cow
whose bell had attracted the attorney’s attention,
was slowly coming toward them. The pursuers
hastened ahead to meet the man.</p>

<p>“D’you see an airship sailing out here?”
called out the attorney.</p>

<p>The herdsman looked up blankly. On a venture,
Deputy Pusey addressed him in German.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Some intelligence came into the old man’s face.
Then he nodded his head and pointed north.</p>

<p>“He thought it was a big bird,” explained
the deputy with a sneer. “And he says it flew
low like a hawk.”</p>

<p>He questioned the man some minutes, and then
added:</p>

<p>“As near as I can make out, the kid kept
down below the trees and then disappeared in
them. That means he probably kept going till
he struck the Little Town pike about two miles
north. He couldn’t fly into the trees. He’s
took the Little Town road. Like as not he’s
headed for Little Town.”</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at his watch. It was three-forty-five.</p>

<p>“It’s no use to hurry now,” he explained.
“We’ll go on till we come to the section road
and cross over to the Little Town pike. Then
we’ll go to Little Town. We’ll probably meet
some one who’s seen him. If we don’t we’ll
get supper at that place an’ do some telephonin’.
He can’t hide that thing out in the open country.”</p>

<p>Some minutes before Bud’s estimated return,
Josh Camp, perched upon the roof of the mill,
set up a shout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here he comes,” was his cry to those waiting
below, and almost before Josh could reach
the ground, the bird-like craft was slowly drifting
to rest in the mill place—the engine shut off,
and the propellers at rest. Eager hands caught
it and eased it to the ground, and Bud, trembling
under the strain, climbed stiffly from his seat.</p>

<p>“I’ve had the time of my life,” he began
abruptly. “Old Andy Pusey chased me around
the track with some kind of a paper—said I was
under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Are they after you?” interrupted Mr.
“Stump” Camp at once.</p>

<p>“Sure,” went on Bud. “Mr. Stockwell and
Andy had a buggy and Pusey’s big bay horse.
You can bet they’re after me. But I don’t
believe they saw me after I got in the ‘slashins.’
I didn’t see them.”</p>

<p>Bud’s hands trembled so that he could
scarcely assist in disposing of the aeroplane.
But he was hardly needed. Before five o’clock,
the airship had been hauled into the sawing
shed on the log car, drawn to the roof by means
of the waiting tackles and the false floor put into
place. To the uninformed, a glance into the shed
suggested as unlikely a place for hiding a forty-foot
aeroplane as the top of a haystack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>It was yet an hour before supper time, and
the irrepressible Bud and Josh set out at once
to select a place for the next day’s flight.</p>

<p>“An’ don’t be late,” called out Mrs. Camp.
“We got fried chicken, sweet potato pie and
hickorynut cake.”</p>

<p>About the time the Camps, Bud, and the hired
hands were attacking a big platter of fried
chicken, Attorney Stockwell and Deputy Sheriff
Pusey were making the best supper they could
out of yellow cheese, dried beef and crackers in
the Little Town general store. This accomplished,
the lawyer, tracing in a general way on
a county map the probable course of the lost
aeroplane, called by telephone those farmers who,
in his judgment, might have seen the airship.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Bud, the Camp’s Mill telephone
was out of order. The operator in Scottsville
could not tell what was the matter. She had
no way of knowing that the wily mill owner had
taken the instrument off the hook just after Josh
announced the returning aeroplane was in sight.
Josh’s report that there had been telephoning
in Little Town the day before was tip enough
to the unlearned but crafty farmer.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for Bud, an incident occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
in the general store a little later that set
the lawyer to thinking.</p>

<p>“Hey, Phil,” called out the proprietor, “I
don’t see no charge o’ that five gallon o’ gasoline
Josh Camp got this mornin’.”</p>

<p>Phil’s excuse was lost on Attorney Stockwell.
He looked at Deputy Pusey significantly. The
moment the officer’s horse had finished his oats,
the two men were in the buggy hurrying toward
Camp’s Mill, a locality as well known to both of
them as to Bud. At seven o’clock, it was growing
dusk. When the buggy turned from the road
into the open space before the mill, Mr. Camp,
Josh, and Bud were sitting on the porch, the
former with his cob pipe. Mr. Camp nudged
Bud, who rolled off the edge of the porch onto
the grass and crawled around the house.</p>

<p>The greeting between the deputy and the mill
owner was that of old friends, but Attorney
Stockwell did not stop for civilities. He became
officious at once.</p>

<p>“Say, Camp,” he exclaimed, “we have reason
to believe you know something about some stolen
property.”</p>

<p>Before he could say more, the deputy interrupted
his companion to explain in detail what
had happened. Then he added why they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
come to the mill, telling of Josh’s gasoline purchase.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Camp, drawing on his not
very fragrant pipe. “Can’t I buy gasoline if I
like?”</p>

<p>“Don’t beat around the bush,” broke in Attorney
Stockwell.</p>

<p>“Look a’ here, Stockwell,” exclaimed old
“Stump.” “I never did have the best opinion o’
you. I don’t like to say right out I think you’re
a shyster cause I ain’t lookin’ to start nothin’.
An’ that’s more considerate than some bluffers
I know.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen the machine?” put in the deputy
again, anxious to avoid trouble.</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about the law,” drawled
the mill owner, “but I got a hunch I don’t have
to answer that less’n I want to.”</p>

<p>“Don’t lose time with him,” sneered the lawyer.
“You have the authority. Search the
place. I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>“So’ll I,” volunteered Mr. Camp. “Ef ye find
any flyin’-machine on this place or round about,
yer welcome to it. Mr. Deputy, you do your duty.
An’ when you’re convinced, git.”</p>

<p>The lawyer and the deputy began rather unsystematically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to look about the premises, starting
first for the lumber piles below the mill.</p>

<p>“Better look in the mill afore it’s too dark,”
suggested Mr. Camp, pointing to the sawing
shed.</p>

<p>The lawyer sneered again.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ll look amongst them piles of
timber,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Deputy Pusey followed the mill owner up the
little track to the long, open shed and peered
inside.</p>

<p>“Like to climb up into the attic?” asked Mr.
Camp, carefully filling his pipe, and nodding
upward.</p>

<p>The officer smiled, turned and shook his head.
When it was completely dark and the two
searchers had returned to the buggy empty
handed, Mr. Camp was sitting on the fence, his
pipe sputtering and glowing in the black night.</p>

<p>“Camp,” exclaimed Attorney Stockwell angrily,
“I think you know a good deal more’n
you’re lettin’ on.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s right, Mr. Stockwell,”
drawled the mill owner, without changing his
position. “I wouldn’t be supprized ef I told
all I knowed ’at a certain lawyer might take to
the woods. D’you find any airships?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>With a curse, the lawyer sprang into his
buggy and drove rapidly away. Before the
buggy was out of sound, a small figure seemed
to appear out of the grass back of the silent man
on the fence. It was Bud, a little nervous, but
with a wide smile.</p>

<p>“Say, Mr. Camp,” he exclaimed, “I was kind
o’ scart when you askt ole Pusey to git up there
in the attic where the machine was.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked the old man.</p>

<p>“’Cause I was up there, hidin’.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>BUD DISCOVERS A FRIEND.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Even the fragrant restfulness of Mrs. Camp’s
spare bedroom did not make Bud sleep soundly
that night. For almost the first time in his life,
he was restless. In the morning, he was far
from as lively as he had been the day before.</p>

<p>“What’s ailin’ ye, Son?” began Mr. Camp
when they sat down to the usual ham, eggs and
biscuits. “You don’t seem very peart to-day.
Ain’t afeerd air ye?”</p>

<p>Bud only shook his head and tried to smile.</p>

<p>“I didn’t sleep well,” was his answer. “I
reckon I’m tired o’ all this excitement.”</p>

<p>Mr. Camp looked at him closely, but said no
more. When breakfast was over and Bud
started toward the sawing shed, Mr. Camp followed
him.</p>

<p>“Now ye better git it offen yer mind, Bud.
Tell me yer troubles.”</p>

<p>The boy made another feeble effort to say he
was all right. Then, his voice trembling a little,
he said hastily:</p>

<p>“I’m kind o’ lonesome, Mr. Camp. An’ you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
folks have been so good to me that it makes me
all the lonesomer.”</p>

<p>The grizzled mill owner laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why yer botherin’ ’bout that.
We ain’t seen nur heerd much o’ ye fur a good
many years. But your folks was purty good
friends o’ mother an’ me. An’ ye knowed Josh.
Why, Bud, it seems almost like as ye was related
to us. We’ll be glad to hev ye come out
here whenever ye like.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Mr. Camp. But I didn’t mean
that exactly. I ain’t got no home now. An’ I
ain’t got no education. An’ I’m purt near too
old to go to school ef I could.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t got no home?”</p>

<p>Bud related how he had been cast out by Attorney
Stockwell; how all his worldly possessions
were in the little bundle he had brought
with him the night before; and how he had now
in his pocket just five dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Camp’s whiskers worked violently. He
tried to ask two or three questions at once.
Mainly, why Bud hadn’t told him this, and how
it happened that he was working for nothing in
such a dangerous enterprise. The boy satisfied
him as well as he could.</p>

<p>“Now,” interrupted the old man, at last, “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
ain’t got but one thing to say. Yer a goin’ to
turn over this craft this evenin’ to the fair folks,
air ye?”</p>

<p>Bud nodded his head.</p>

<p>“An’ ye’ll quit without no wages and without
no home?”</p>

<p>Bud nodded his head again.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve give Josh leave to take the old
sorrel and drive his mother to the fair to-day—I
got to be the startin’ engine myself. They’ll
be there long afore you git there. When yer’s
flyin’ ’s all over, ye’ll git right into the spring
wagon with ’em and come right out here to old
‘Stump’ Camp’s. This here’ll be yer home till
ye git another.”</p>

<p>The tears came into Bud’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t do that, Mr. Camp. I haven’t any
money—”</p>

<p>“Don’t I need hands?” interrupted Mr.
Camp, with assumed gruffness.</p>

<p>“If you’ll let me work for you?” began Bud.
But again he was interrupted.</p>

<p>“Ye don’t need to do that long,” Mr. Camp
hastened to say. “Your gaurdeen, Mr. Stockwell,
didn’t spare me none last night. If I
ain’t mistook there’s somepin comin’ to ye, Bud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
An’ I’m goin’ to make it my business to see ’at
ye git yer jest dues.”</p>

<p>“You mean the farm?” exclaimed Bud.</p>

<p>“Sure’s yer born,” continued <a href="#image04">Mr. Camp</a>, rubbing
his chin. “An’ mebbe more. I’ve heered
a good deal I ain’t said nothin’ about to you.”</p>

<p>“But there’s Jack Stanley and his wife!
They are the only ones who can help me, aren’t
they? You said they could give me a clear title
to my property. I’ve got to see them before
they leave the fair to-night.”</p>

<p>The old man slowly winked at the lad.</p>

<p>“Ketched,” he chuckled. “I didn’t mean
to tell ye about it, Bud. But after Mr. Stockwell
got so fresh with me las’ night, I jes made up
my mind to hand him somepin’ an’ help you a little
at the same time.”</p>

<p>The sawmill owner reached into the hip pocket
of his trousers and <a href="#image04">drew out an envelope</a>. On
it, addressed in an awkward hand, were these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Mr. John Reed or Jack Stanley,<br />
<span class="padl9">Fair Grounds.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>“That’s why Josh an’ mother air a goin’ to
the fair,” he chuckled again. “An’ ef this
don’t bring my old friend Stanley’s wife and
son-in-law out to Camp’s Mill by to-morrer, I
miss my guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202-<br />203]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you are doin’ this to try to get them
to fix my property for me?” Bud asked, his
lip quivering.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m jes doin’ it—that’s all,” answered
Mr. Camp. “Now, you set yer mind at ease. I
ain’t askin’ no credit. I jes want to hear Cy
Stockwell swear. That’s all.”</p>

<p>When two o’clock came that day, Josh and
Mrs. Camp were on the fair-grounds. Instead
of the somewhat stiff mill owner, one of the mill
hands had been substituted as the motive power
to start the spring wagon down hill. Mr. Camp,
the two hands and Bud had safely conveyed the
aeroplane through the wood road, up over the
hill (knocking down two fences in the process)
and the greased spring wagon stood like an Atlas
with the waiting airship balanced on its
body.</p>

<p>In all its history there had been no such attendance
on the Scott County fair as poured
through the gates on this Saturday. The story
of what Bud had done had at last become public,
and the entire town was alive with gossip and
comment. The details became such a sensation
and were so well known that it wasn’t “Goin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
out to the grounds?” that day. The morning
salutation was, “Goin’ out to see Bud Wilson
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>Lafe Pennington, now fully recovered, had
been a spectator of Bud’s return and escape.
He had the good taste to make no comment, but
it was a sore trial to his pride. After Bud’s spectacular
exhibition and flight the day before,
President Elder, all smiles over his defeat of the
enemy, was hastening from the judges’ stand
when he espied Lafe.</p>

<p>“Hello, Lafe,” called out the jubilant official.
Lafe wanted to escape, but he couldn’t. “Do
you know what they’re all sayin’, Lafe?” continued
Mr. Elder, edging up to the embarrassed
bank clerk. “They’re talkin’ it around town
that the old gypsy scared you. Folks say you
were scar’t to run the airship.”</p>

<p>“Well, let ’em,” retorted Lafe. “Talk’s
cheap. They’d be tellin’ another story if they
knew the facts. It ain’t much to guide an aeroplane.
But I’d like to see any one else in this
town set one up and get it ready.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued President Elder, “you can
shut ’em up next week if you want to. If we get
our dispute adjusted over the flyin’-machine,
we got an offer to make an exhibition at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
State Fair. It’s gone all over the state. Biggest
thing any fair ever had.”</p>

<p>Lafe was visibly disturbed.</p>

<p>“How’d you like to try your hand up to the
State Fair?” asked Mr. Elder, with pretended
seriousness.</p>

<p>“You gentlemen have made your choice,” faltered
Lafe. “You’ve picked out your operator.
I ain’t takin’ none of Bud Wilson’s leavin’s.”</p>

<p>As Lafe hurried away, Mr. Elder smiled. Although
Lafe was again in the crowd the next day,
he took good care to avoid the president.</p>

<p>Bud, now eager to escape from his responsibility,
was a little ahead of time in reaching
the grounds on his last flight. But he did not
arrive before the crowd. The grand-stand, race
track, and part of the enclosure were jammed
again. The nervous eagerness, the restless scanning
of the sky in all directions and the spectators’
impatience were rewarded about five
minutes before three o’clock, when the dark, oblong
aeroplane was made out in the sky north
of the grounds.</p>

<p>This day, the band was prepared, and as Bud
whirled into the course, the vociferous musicians
struck up La Poloma—more appropriate than
the leader knew, as the translation of the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
means “The Dove.” But Bud wasn’t a
white dove that day. Old “Stump” Camp,
either from a sense of humor or a love for the
beautiful, had proposed and actually decorated
the bare aeroplane framework with flowers.</p>

<p>The gaudiest blooms in Mother Camp’s garden
had been tied to the car uprights, and right and
left of the young aviator were bunches of pink,
red and white hollyhocks that met almost in an
arch over Bud’s head. At each end, there was
single, mammoth sunflowers. Even across the
track enclosure, the decorations could be made
out, and the usual “Ahs” and “Ohs” soon
swelled into a wave of amused admiration.</p>

<p>Again the crowd surged forward and back,
horses backed and reared, and the band umpahed
and quavered.</p>

<p>With knowledge born of the previous day’s
experience, the crowd parted as the circling car
came into the head of the stretch on its first lap,
and Bud had no occasion to call out warnings.
He was greeted with salutations of all kinds.
This time, with growing confidence, he felt able
to look about. His eyes sought eagerly for his
foster father, Mr. Dare, or the deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>Then he smiled and the crowd yelled. But
Bud was smiling because his quick eyes had detected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
what he hoped to find. Over in front of
the deserted “aerodrome,” he saw the three men.
He had guessed right. Since the fair would conclude
that day, Bud realized that there was no
longer any object in trying to hide the aeroplane.
Whatever legal fight was to be made could now
be carried on without embarrassment to the fair
association.</p>

<p>“My work’s done,” Bud had said to himself.
“All I want to do now is to turn over the machine
and get away. And I’m goin’ to get away quick.
They said I was under arrest. Not if I know it.”</p>

<p>Then the aeroplane approached the crowded
grand-stand. As it did so, Bud threw his vertical
lever slightly to the starboard and brought the
car just in front of the packed seats. Every one
sprang up, open-mouthed and curious. As the
graceful car drifted by the structure, the young
aviator, smiling, reached out to the nearest of his
vertical frames and jerked loose a large pink
bundle. With another swift motion, the mass of
pink went whirling through the air toward the
spectators. Hundreds of spicy, clove-pinks separated
and fluttered among the outstretched
hands.</p>

<p>At considerable risk, Bud jerked off his hat
and leaned forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“For the ladies,” he shouted, “with the compliments
of Mr. Elder.”</p>

<p>In the roar of thousands of voices, yelling and
laughing, the aeroplane shot by. On the back
stretch of the track, Bud again made sure that
Mr. Stockwell and Deputy Pusey were at the airship
shed. As he passed on his second round, the
cries were deafening.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the hollyhocks?”</p>

<p>“Give us a sunflower?”</p>

<p>“Have ’em all in a few minutes,” thought Bud.</p>

<p>As the third round began, Bud set himself for
his finish.</p>

<p>“They’ll certainly figure that I’m going to
come down to-day,” he said to himself. “And
I am. But not where they’re waitin’ for me.”</p>

<p>The natural thing for the aviator to do would
be to pass by the grand-stand, thus completing
his third circuit, and then, at the lower end of the
track, to make a quick turn and head directly up
the center of the enclosure to the shed. What
every one expected, Bud did not do. He didn’t
propose to stop for explanations or to be arrested.</p>

<p>As the aeroplane approached the grand-stand,
Bud made a sweeping turn into the track enclosure,
shut off his power, and, with a graceful
dip over the heads of the spectators, sank swiftly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
toward the ground where the crowd had thinned
into groups.</p>

<p>In the crowd was one young man who noted
every movement of Bud’s with a trained eye.
Neither Bud nor those standing next to the
square shouldered young stranger knew that
Sergeant Morey Marshall of the U. S. Signal
Corps, stationed at Omaha, had been rushed to
Scottsville on the first express to observe and report
on the daring flight of the amateur aviator.
If Bud Wilson had known it part of his composure
might have left him for, to the Hoosier lad,
Morey Marshall, the hero of “In the Clouds for
Uncle Sam,” stood along side such operators as
Wright and Curtiss in skilful daring as an aviator.
There came a time when the two boys met
and were glad to know each other.</p>

<p>“Ketch her,” cried Bud sharply. Almost before
any one knew what had taken place, twenty
willing hands had the sinking car in their grip.
While it was still in the air, supported by the
proud volunteers, Bud drew his feet from his
stirrups, caught the framework and dropped
nimbly to the ground. Hundreds of persons were
already massed around the mysterious craft.
One after another turned to speak to or shake
the hand of Bud, but, somehow, when President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Elder at last reached the spot, out of breath, Bud
was gone.</p>

<p>And, strangely enough, although it was early
in the afternoon, the aeroplane had no sooner
landed than Mrs. “Stump” Camp and her son,
Josh, made their way to the hitch racks and
hooked up the old sorrel. Another strange thing—they
did not go home by way of Scottsville, but
took the longer way east to the “slashings.”
About a half mile east of the road leading into
the fair-ground, the old sorrel drew up, and Bud
Wilson, considerably puffed by his long run
through the intermediate cornfields, stepped out
of a fence corner and climbed into the rear seat.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock the same evening, two
boney horses drawing a gaudily-painted gypsy
van passed over the Scottsville bridge toward
Little Town. It was Jack Stanley on his way to
take Sunday dinner with old “Stump” Camp.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE PRIVATE OFFICE OF THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The following Monday morning, an odd little
caravan marched around the Scottsville public
square toward the First National Bank. Old
“Stump” Camp, in his black Sunday hat, and
freshly shaven down to his lower cheeks where
his wide-spreading whiskers began, led the
group. By his side was Madame Zecatacas, the
Gypsy Queen, her long earrings bobbing. Behind
them, walked “Jack Stanley,” her son-in-law,
and his wife. Their child was, at that moment,
assisting Mother Camp to sugar doughnuts,
eight miles away at Camp’s Mill.</p>

<p>“Stump” Camp was not ignored at the First
National Bank, and when he escorted his followers
into that austere financial institution and
asked to see President Elder, he was led into the
latter’s private office at once. What followed behind
the closed door in the next twenty minutes
or so was a question that more than worried the
bookkeeper, cashier and clerk, Lafe Pennington,
in the outside room.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to borry no money,” began Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Camp when President Elder greeted him with the
usual banker’s coolness. “Nor I ain’t come to
pay none.”</p>

<p>The banker made courteous offers of chairs to
all.</p>

<p>“These air some ole friends o’ mine,” went on
the mill owner, selecting a chair near a cuspidor,
“an’ they’re a goin’ to help me help some one
else.”</p>

<p>“Well, Camp, what can I do for you? Tradin’
horses again?”</p>

<p>The farmer-miller shook his head.</p>

<p>“Me an’ you knowed Bud Wilson’s father,
Josiah.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” responded the banker. “And
I’ve just come to know the boy.”</p>

<p>“So’ve I,” exclaimed Mr. Camp, drawing
over and using the cuspidor. “That’s the pint.
An’ to keep to the pint, I got to tell you somepin’
mebbe ye don’t know. Bud’s father was a neighbor
o’ mine, as ye might say. An’ we farmers
sort o’ keep clost watch o’ each other. When ye
knowed Mr. Wilson, he lived in town.”</p>

<p>“Then he bought a farm out your way—out
about Little Town.”</p>

<p>“He did. An’ what’s curious, he paid for it—cash—four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
thousand eight hundred dollars for
eighty acres.”</p>

<p>The bank president seemed to be thinking.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’ll be Bud’s when the boy’s of
age?” he suggested, at last.</p>

<p>“They ain’t no title to it,” remarked old
Camp, with a judicial air.</p>

<p>“That’s what I was trying to recall,” said Mr.
Elder. “Seems to me I’ve heard Attorney
Stockwell say so.”</p>

<p>“There ye air,” exclaimed the bewhiskered
mill owner, rising and striking the table.
“Stockwell! There ye said it. He’s this boy’s
gardeen an’ ought to be lookin’ out fur him ef
all’s on the square. Why ain’t he cleared the
title to that land? Why ain’t he, the old skin?
I’ll tell ye why, Mr. Elder. He don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“How’s that,” asked the bank president, leaning
forward, with interest.</p>

<p>“Anybody goin’ to buy that land offen the boy
when he gits it ’thouten a title?”</p>

<p>“I reckon not,” ventured Mr. Elder.</p>

<p>“There ye said it,” snapped Mr. Camp, his
whiskers vibrating in his excitement. “No one
exceptin’ his gardeen mebbe fur little nor
nuthin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean that the boy’s guardian has neglected
this to injure the title to the property?”</p>

<p>“When the boy comes o’ age, the farm’ll be
his. He ain’t no farmer, nur don’t want to be.
He’ll put the track up fur sale. Who’ll buy it?
Nobody—exceptin’ the gardeen—Mr. Lawyer
Cyrus Stockwell, an’ at his own price.”</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Mr. Elder, leaning back into
his chair, “what good will it do him? Won’t be
worth any more to him, will it?”</p>

<p>“Onless he turns around an’ finds the persons
’at kin give him a title. But he won’t. Them
folks is right here. They air a goin’ to make a
deed right here this mornin’, an’ it’ll run to Bud
Wilson. They air a goin’ to sign the dockyment
right here that’ll make Bud’s farm worth one
hundred and twenty-five dollars an acre o’ any
man’s money.”</p>

<p>Then, while the interested banker followed old
“Stump’s” explanation eagerly, Mr. Camp told
how Jack Stanley and his wife, the direct heirs
of William Reed and his wife, who had failed to
properly transfer the property to Bud’s father,
were ready and even eager to see justice done.
They were prepared to sign a deed at once.</p>

<p>The keen, business man drew a long breath,
and looked long and hard at the silent gypsies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Camp,” he said at last, “how’d you work
this out?”</p>

<p>“Jack Stanley” spoke, for the first time.</p>

<p>In his rough way he told of his brief acquaintance
with Bud from the time the boy came to him
at midnight for coffee; how Bud had interfered
to protect his mother-in-law from insult; how the
boy had treated them as “white people,” and
finally recalled to the bank officer and fair director
how Bud had come to the rescue of himself
and old Madame Zecatacas when they had
been so unjustly arrested.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” mused Mr. Elder, “we couldn’t
do a thing with him till we got you out. He’d
work for us for nothin’, but not till we got you
out of jail.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you,” exclaimed Jack to old
Zecatacas. “Ain’t he on the square for fair?
Dat’s why, mister.”</p>

<p>The wrinkled Gypsy Queen smiled.</p>

<p>“He is our friend,” she added in a broken
voice. “To his friend, the gypsy gives all.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t no Romney,” added the man, shaking
his head, “but the kid’s all right. It’s comin’
to him, and we’re goin’ to see he gets a square
deal.”</p>

<p>President Elder sat silent for a few moments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and then drew Mr. Camp to the far side of the
room.</p>

<p>“Camp,” he began, curiously, “what’s your
interest in this boy?”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Camp’s chance. While the tobacco-chewing
and illiterate mill owner rapidly
related the story of the last two days, the dignified
bank president chuckled, grinned, and finally
burst into loud guffaws.</p>

<p>“And the joke of it is,” he said, when Mr.
Camp had finished, “that Bud’s fright on the last
day was altogether unnecessary. The machine
is ours. The company accepted our offer by telegraph,
waived their representative’s fee and
called him off.”</p>

<p>“But Bud seen him waitin’ with the deputy,”
insisted the mill owner.</p>

<p>“And I had the telegram to call him off in my
pocket,” explained Mr. Elder.</p>

<p>“Then he wa’n’t goin’ to be arrested?”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder shook his head, and laughed again.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Camp dolefully, “ye might
as well kill a feller as skeer him to death.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder paced the floor a few moments. Then
he asked:</p>

<p>“Where is Bud?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d a brung him, but we was scart he’d be
put in jail. He’s down to the livery stable.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you all come back here in an hour,”
asked Mr. Elder after another pause, “and
bring Bud with you?”</p>

<p>“That’s our business to-day,” chuckled Mr.
Camp.</p>

<p>When they had gone, the bank president sat
back in his chair as if in deep thought for some
minutes. Then he took his hat and walked
hastily out of his room and through the bank.
Mr. Elder went directly to the county courthouse.
There, after using the telephone, he was joined
by a lawyer—but not Attorney Cyrus Stockwell.
Then the two men hastened to the private office
of the judge of the county court, after which they
went to the office of the attorney who had been
summoned by telephone.</p>

<p>From this office, another telephone message
was sent out, and in response to that, Attorney
Cyrus Stockwell was soon hastening toward Mr.
Elder’s lawyer’s office. Here there was apparently
an animated conference. When President
Elder finally made his way back to his own
office, it was fifteen minutes after the appointed
time. “Stump” Camp, Bud and their gypsy
friends were waiting patiently under the bank
awning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>With only a hasty grip of Bud’s hand, Mr.
Elder led the party into the private office once
more. He motioned them to chairs, and then,
with a quick business air, drew out a deed, legally
describing the Reed-Wilson farm and arranged
it for the Stanleys to sign. They did it with
apparent pleasure. Then he read it aloud. The
consideration named was one hundred and fifty
dollars. Bud pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stanley,” explained the banker, “your
friend Bud has some peculiar business ideas. He
has just saved our fair association a good deal of
trouble. He didn’t save us any money, but we’ve
concluded that he saved our pride, and we
agreed Saturday night to pay him three hundred
dollars for what he’d done.”</p>

<p>Bud tried to speak.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t your time, yet, young man,” interrupted
the banker. “I’m goin’ to pay these
honest people one hundred and fifty dollars for
their trouble in comin’ in here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elder stepped out into the banking room,
and a moment later returned with two packages
of one hundred and fifty dollars each. One he
handed to “Jack Stanley.”</p>

<p>“And now,” he added to the gypsies, “if you
folks would like to do a little shoppin’ before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
start back to the country, I’d like a few minutes’
talk with Bud and Mr. Camp.”</p>

<p>Stanley hesitated and looked at his mother-in-law,
Madame Zecatacas. The latter turned
toward Bud. The boy, hardly knowing what to
do, paused a moment, and then, holding out his
hand, pointed to his “good luck” ring, which he
still wore. Stepping to Stanley, Bud took the
package of money and pressed it into Madame
Zecatacas’ hand.</p>

<p>“Here, Mrs. Zecatacas, I don’t hardly know
what this all means, but this is from me to you.
And ‘good luck’ with it.”</p>

<p>With dignity, the three gypsies slowly left the
room.</p>

<p>For a moment, President Elder sat and
drummed on the table with his fingers.</p>

<p>“Bud,” he said at last, “you seem to have the
sudden faculty of making good friends. These
good people—including my old friend Camp here—are
no better friends of yours than I am. When
I see any one gettin’ the worst of it, I want to
give ’em a lift. That right ‘Stump’?”</p>

<p>“That’s my motto.”</p>

<p>“Well,” went on the banker, “you’ve been
gettin’ the worst of it, Bud. You’re eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
years old, and you’ve got the stuff in you to do
things. But you’ve got to get an education.”</p>

<p>Bud smiled and shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Mr. Camp tells me Mr. Stockwell has put you
out of his house, and that you are going to live
with him.”</p>

<p>“If he’ll let me,” said Bud. “But he can’t
keep me for nothing. I’ll have to work, and
while I’m workin’ I can’t go to school.”</p>

<p>“Are you through the grammar school?”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” confessed Bud, his face reddening.
“I never seemed to get ahead. I was always
in trouble, and whenever I seemed to be
gettin’ a start, Mr. Stockwell would take me out
an’ put me to work a spell. Even ef I had the
money, I ain’t never goin’ to the high school here.
I’m too old.”</p>

<p>“What would you like to do?”</p>

<p>“I could go to the normal school, over to Green
County, in the winter an’ work for Mr. Camp in
the summer.”</p>

<p>“What’d that cost you?”</p>

<p>“Cost him ’bout eight dollars a week. Josh
figured on it,” answered Mr. Camp.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Elder, throwing himself
back into his chair, “you can do that!”</p>

<p>Bud gulped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“I been doin’ a little hasty investigatin’ while
I was out. What I found out I got to look into
further, but it’s nigh enough right I reckon to
make it worth tellin’. Mr. Stockwell, as your
guardian and the executor of your father’s estate,
ain’t made but one report to the court in ten
years. Two years after your father died, he reported
that he’d been rentin’ the farm at six dollars
an acre, cash rent. That meant four hundred,
and eighty dollars a year, or nine hundred and
sixty dollars for the two years. Agin that, he offset
one hundred and twenty dollars for taxes, five
hundred and twenty dollars for your board and
clothes, and two hundred and forty dollars ‘for
fences an’ repairs.’ The court allowed it. Since
that time, he ain’t made no report.”</p>

<p>Bud wrinkled his brow in an effort to comprehend.
But old “Stump” Camp understood and
chuckled.</p>

<p>“The fences don’t need rebuildin’ very often,”
went on Mr. Elder, “and, allowin’ the same
amount for your board an’ clothes, I figure that
Mr. Stockwell must owe you considerable more
than one thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got it to pay,” exclaimed Bud at
once thinking of Mrs. Stockwell. “An’, besides,
I don’t want it. He wasn’t very bad to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s for the Court to say,” continued Mr.
Elder. “At least, since you’re not living with
him now, there’s anyway over five hundred dollars
a year comin’ to you from that land from
now on.”</p>

<p>“And,” added Mr. Camp, crossing the room
to the cuspidor, and parting his flowing beard,
“in three years, when you git yer edication,
there’ll be the eighty acres. I’ll give you ten
thousand dollars fur it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Elder,” said Bud at last, his voice choking,
“I told you one day last week I wanted to
do something in this town because I wanted to
‘make good.’”</p>

<p>The pleased and smiling banker looked at him.
Then he pointed to the package of one hundred
and fifty dollars on the table.</p>

<p>“That shows you made good with us,” he said,
as Bud stood looking at the money.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that,” Bud exclaimed with
feeling. “I wanted to ‘make good’ with some
one that counted. If I ‘made good’ with you and
with Mr. Camp, I’m satisfied—I’m happy.”</p>

<p>“Let’s all go down to my house for dinner,”
said Mr. Elder, turning away abruptly as if to
change the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t,” answered Bud, picking up the package
of bills. “I want to go right out and give this
to Mrs. Stockwell. Mr. Camp,” he added, as he
grasped the old man’s hand, “I’ll be waitin’ at
the livery stable fur you as soon as I kin git
back.”</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
